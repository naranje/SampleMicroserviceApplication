Geared more for the desktop than the network closet, Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional has its own collection of features to be capitalized upon and quirks to be accommodated. A couple of esteemed Windows authors--Mark Minasi and Todd Phillips--weigh in on the new and improved operating system in Mastering Windows 2000 Professional. Their expertise and obviously thorough research have yielded a fine book. This is a super choice for power users, systems administrators, and others who want a detailed picture of Windows 2000 Professional''s features and how they work.
 This is a big, comprehensive treatment of the whole OS, but it manages to avoid the tedium that befalls most of the books in this category. Rather than dryly documenting which interface elements do what, the authors explain how to wring top performance from your computer by telling you rather a lot about the Windows 2000 architecture and its place in networks. Sure, you get the how-to procedures you''d expect, but the prose is the main attraction here. That''s where Minasi and Phillips share their knowledge about optimization, troubleshooting, and other tricks of their trade. Lots of OS books claim to be loaded with hints and tricks, but this one really is. Mastering Windows 2000 Professional will answer your novice and intermediate questions, but it more importantly will help you become an expert. --David Wall
Topics covered: Windows 2000 Professional, as it applies to novice and intermediate users who want to increase their level of competence. Early chapters deal with managing files and running applications before explaining how to hook up to the Internet. More advanced coverage goes to networking, performance tweaking, and problem-solving. Though they don''t say, it seems likely from this book''s ship date that the authors based their research on a late beta version of the OS (probably Release Candidate 2) that was very similar to the final product.

Product Description
Mark Minasi, the world''s #1 Windows NT authority, brings to Microsoft''s new generation of Windows operating systems his technical expertise and ability to make topics easy to understand. Completely updated, this second edition teems with in-depth coverage of features new to Windows 2000 Professional, including the file encryption system, Sychronization Manager, and Installer Service, advanced topics such as security and the Registry, and networking topics including administration and remote access. Great for beginners or advanced users, this is an indispensable resource for NT administrators, MCSE candidates, and business and home office users, whether upgrading from Win9X or Windows NT 4.

Mark Minasi rocks the casbah as far as Microsoft''s enterprise operating   systems are concerned--his books have been bestsellers for a long time, and   deservedly so. Minasi''s latest offering, Mastering Windows 2000 Server,   upholds his tradition of technical accuracy and thoroughness, presented in a   shell of pedagogical soundness. This heavy, hardback volume goes far beyond the   usual feature-by-feature documentation. In addition to the how-to material, the   book includes details (roughly, oh, a zillion of them) that clearly derive from   experimentation and an exhaustive study of Microsoft''s support databases.
    A typical example of Mastering''s thoroughness (for which Minasi''s three   coauthors deserve credit, too) is its explanation of how to restrict access to   programs on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 clients. (They''re covered in these pages on   the logic that homogeneous Windows 2000 networks are rare.) In that section,   you''ll find not only instructions for locking down programs via the Registry,   but also a discussion of ways to get around Registry restrictions (via Cmd.exe,   macro languages, and so on)--almost everything gets that kind of attention. And   administrators will appreciate being able to locate the information that they   want (in the depth in which they want it) with just a quick index scan. Users of   the Macintosh and Novell clients: look here for the help that you need in   getting machines to interoperate properly. --David Wall

Perl has always been a powerful and popular programming  language, but with its new object capabilities, it can do even  more. Written for anyone with a little Perl experience, Damian  Conway''s Object Oriented Perl provides an invaluable guide to  virtually every aspect of object-oriented programming in Perl.
 The  most notable thing about Object Oriented Perl is Conway''s  excellent perspective on object-oriented concepts and how they are  implemented in Perl. This book does a remarkable job of cutting  through traditional jargon and illustrating how basic object-oriented  design techniques are handled in Perl. (A useful appendix attests to  the author''s wide-ranging knowledge, with a comparison of Smalltalk,  Eiffel, C++, and Java with Perl, including a summary of  object-oriented syntax for each.) This book also features a truly  excellent review of basic Perl syntax.
 Throughout this text, the  author shows you the basics of solid object design (illustrated using  classes that model music CDs). Basic concepts like inheritance and  polymorphism get thorough and clear coverage. The book also points out  common mistakes and provides many tips for navigating the powerful and  flexible (yet sometimes tricky) nuances of using Perl objects. For  instance, Conway shows how to achieve true data encapsulation in Perl  (which generally allows calls across modules) as well as its natural  support for generic programming techniques. 
 He also pays special  attention to popular object modules available from CPAN (like  Class::MethodmakerK, which simplifies declaring classes) and  discusses performance issues and the tradeoff between programming  convenience and speed often faced by today''s Perl developer. Advanced  chapters cover a number of techniques for adding persistence and  invoking methods using multiple dispatching.
 Filled with syntactic  tips and tricks, Object Oriented Perl is a sure bet for any  programmer who wants to learn how to use Perl objects  effectively. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Perl  language review, CPAN, Perl objects, ''blessing'' and inheritance,  polymorphism, Class::Struct and Class::Methodmaker modules, Perl ties  and closures, operator overloading, encapsulation, multiple dispatch,  Class::Multimethods, coarse-grained and fine-grained object  persistence techniques, performance issues.

Product Description
Discusses how to build objects for hashes, arrays, scalars, pseudo-hashes, subroutines, regular expressions, or typeglobs, master encapulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, and advanced topics such as operator overloading, tied variables, generic programming, and persistence.  Softcover. DLC: Object-oriented programming (Computer Science).

Despite their tremendous popularity, design patterns are extremely challenging to learn. Now there''s an introduction designed to help beginners get up-to-speed fast -- and help them overcome the obstacles that stand in their way. The best way to teach design patterns is to present key tradeoffs and heuristics through practical examples. In The Joy of Patterns, Brandon Goldfedder does just that, presenting a series of system designs from initial conception through code. The book''s examples illustrate the use of patterns to design systems that will be implemented in Visual Basic, C++, and Java. Goldfedder focuses on a core subset of patterns, drawing upon the work of the "Gang of Four" and other leaders in the field. Along the way, he covers the most common applications for patterns, illuminating the pros and cons designers need to consider in making key decisions about system architecture. For all application developers, programmers, project managers, architects, and others who want to master patterns -- including those who have previously found them difficult to learn.

Aimed at the intermediate or advanced Java developer, Design Patterns Java Workbook provides an in-depth and challenging look at 23 "classic" software patterns illustrated with Java examples.
This title fills a valuable niche by reprising the well-known guide to patterns, Addison-Wesley''s Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Software Design. While that earlier book relied on C++ and Smalltalk for its examples, this new volume uses Java code for the discussion of the same 23 design techniques. Many of the explanations draw on the author''s custom classes for a hypothetical fireworks company, supplemented by material using "core" classes in standard Java. This text shows how to both recognize patterns in existing code and to incorporate them into new designs.
Early sections look at interfaces, including a standout section on trees and the Composite pattern. For the chapter on responsibility patterns, veteran Java programmers will appreciate the use of JDBC used to explain the Bridge pattern and tips for spotting other patterns in everyday Java. Builder patterns come next, with a full tour of ways to construct objects more flexibly. When it comes to operations patterns, a notable section on the Interpreter pattern presents some challenging material on language parsers.
Final chapters on extension patterns show how Java classes can extend one another using inheritance and other design principles. The discussion here of Java stream classes as examples of decorator patterns can help explain these rich (and sometimes confusing) sets of objects. Another useful section on Iterators shows how to create "type-safe" collections (normally not available in Java). Throughout this text, the author challenges the reader with dozens of easy-to-difficult questions (including actual design exercises). Complete answers are provided at the end of the book.
As a hands-on workbook that will invite you to think about patterns in Java in new ways, this text is an invaluable companion to earlier titles on patterns. Its mix of design smarts and clever examples help make it ideal for the more advanced programmer. Less experienced readers can also benefit from its intelligent presentation of some of the best available thinking in software design today, now tailored to a Java audience. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Presents examples, exercises, and challenges that enable you to grapple with alternative approaches and discover practical subtleties in applying design pattern theory to realistic problems. Softcover. CD-ROM included.

One of the most important recent developments in software  engineering is the Unified Modeling Language (UML) standard for  documenting software designs. Written by UML''s inventors (the  so-called Three Amigos of software engineering), The Unified  Modeling Language User Guide provides a very appealing guide to  all the fundamentals of using UML effectively. The book opens with a  basic tour of the essential concepts and modeling diagrams used in  UML, including class diagrams, use case diagrams, and basic modeling  principles. The authors pay close attention to modeling classes (and  documenting the relationships between classes) as well as use case  diagrams (which show how software will be used by various actors in a  system). This book mixes in a little software-engineering theory, too,  but it makes use of clear examples and actual UML diagrams to  illustrate key concepts.
 Later in the book, the authors discuss  more difficult notational diagrams (such as state diagrams and  activity diagrams, which can be used to model behavior in a  system). Whatever your background in software engineering, you''ll no  doubt appreciate the author''s clear explanations of basic (and  advanced) modeling concepts, as well as the nuts-and-bolts details of  today''s powerful UML. With its combination of expert modeling advice  and excellent detail on the specifics of UML, this book will be  absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to use UML for  real-world software design. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Just as architects and musicians need architectural drawings or music scores to be written using standard notations that everyone agrees on and understands, developers need a single, common, widely usable modeling language for the development of software systems. The UML has been proposed as this standard and has received the support of academic and industry heavyweights.  The Unified Modeling Language User Guide is the first of three definitive UML works written by the creators of UML, Grady Booch, Jim Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson. Together these three widely respected and world-famous methodologists form an unbeatable author team representing combined worldwide sales of their prior individual books of more than 250,000 copies. This book will introduce the core 80% of the UML, approaching it in a layered fashion and providing numerous examples of its application.

Written by the three pioneers behind the Unified Modeling  Language (UML) standard, The Unified Modeling Language Reference  Manual provides an excellent real-world guide to working with  UML. This title provides expert knowledge on all facets of today''s UML  standard, helping developers who are encountering UML on the job for  the first time to be more productive.
 The book begins with a  history of UML, from structured design methods of the ''60s and ''70s to  the competing object-oriented design standards that were unified in  1997 to create UML. For the novice, the authors illustrate key diagram  types such as class, use case, state machine,  activity, and implementation. (Of course,  learning these basic diagram types is what UML is all about. The  authors use an easy-to-understand ticket-booking system for many of their  examples.)
 After a tour of basic document types, The Unified  Modeling Language Reference Manual provides an alphabetical  listing of more than 350 UML terms. Entries range from a sentence or  two to several pages in length. (Class, operation, and  use case are just a few of the important terms that are  covered.) Though you will certainly need to be acquainted with  software engineering principles, this reference will serve the working  software developer well. As the authors note, this isn''t UML for  Dummies, but neither is it an arcane academic treatise. The  authors succeed in delivering a readable reference that will answer  any UML question, no matter how common or obscure. --Richard  DraganProduct Description
The authors have done an outstanding job with this UML book. The definitions of the terms are the best I have seen.

It''s no surprise that object-oriented analysis and design can  work for embedded systems--such as those in VCRs, car engines,  elevators, pacemakers, and other hardware devices--which far outnumber  traditional computers. That''s the argument of Bruce Douglass''s  Real-Time UML, which presents the latest modeling techniques  using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) in the context of embedded  design. This book is a successful introduction to both UML and the  vagaries of embedded systems, which have their own set of pitfalls and  constraints for efficiency and high reliability.
Real-Time  UML is good at presenting the basics of modeling objects, from  class design to object behavior, with an eye for the rich set of  diagrams available in UML used along the way. Examples, from elevators  to medical systems, are used to illustrate the theory.
 The authors  are up to speed with the latest research on "patterns"  (reusable higher order designs) that can be used for embedded  systems--especially within the chapters on design. It''s obvious from  this clearly written and comprehensive book that embedded systems can  benefit from the methodology and notational strengths of UML. This  manual avoids the abstraction of a lot of software engineering texts  and relies on some good real-world detail for its examples. It''s  definitely a recommended source for any embedded-systems developer who  wants to ramp up on the new details of UML.

Product Description
Second Edition now available! Real-time systems programmers face unique challenges. Qualities such as execution speed and memory size are paramount in the development of real-time systems, and performance is a fundamental aspect of correctness in this domain. Given these constraints and requirements, it is fair to say that the development of real-time systems is more challenging than that of most software systems. Yet the lack of a standard notation and design process has discouraged embedded systems developers from adopting a revolutionary new approach to software design--object technology--that has produced clearly identifiable benefits in less specialized software applications.  With the development and wide adoption of a standard notation, the Unified Modified Language (UML), real-time systems developers can now avail themselves of the benefits and advantages of object technology. UML is a 3rd generation modeling language which rigorously defines the semantics of the object metamodel and provides a notation for capturing and communicating object structure and behavior. It is particularly well-suited to modeling real-time and embedded systems.Real-Time UML is the introduction that developers of real-time systems need to make the transition to object-oriented analysis and design and modeling with UML.

</h3>It''s no surprise that object-oriented analysis and design can  work for embedded systems--such as those in VCRs, car engines,  elevators, pacemakers, and other hardware devices--which far outnumber  traditional computers. That''s the argument of Bruce Douglass''s  <I>Real-Time UML</I>, which presents the latest modeling techniques  using the Unified Modeling Language (UML) in the context of embedded  design. This book is a successful introduction to both UML and the  vagaries of embedded systems, which have their own set of pitfalls and  constraints for efficiency and high reliability.<p> <I>Real-Time  UML</I> is good at presenting the basics of modeling objects, from  class design to object behavior, with an eye for the rich set of  diagrams available in UML used along the way. Examples, from elevators  to medical systems, are used to illustrate the theory.<p> The authors  are up to speed with the latest research on "patterns"  (reusable higher order designs) that can be used for embedded  systems--especially within the chapters on design. It''s obvious from  this clearly written and comprehensive book that embedded systems can  benefit from the methodology and notational strengths of UML. This  manual avoids the abstraction of a lot of software engineering texts  and relies on some good real-world detail for its examples. It''s  definitely a recommended source for any embedded-systems developer who  wants to ramp up on the new details of UML.

</h3>Second Edition now available! Real-time systems programmers face unique challenges. Qualities such as execution speed and memory size are paramount in the development of real-time systems, and performance is a fundamental aspect of correctness in this domain. Given these constraints and requirements, it is fair to say that the development of real-time systems is more challenging than that of most software systems. Yet the lack of a standard notation and design process has discouraged embedded systems developers from adopting a revolutionary new approach to software design--object technology--that has produced clearly identifiable benefits in less specialized software applications.  With the development and wide adoption of a standard notation, the Unified Modified Language (UML), real-time systems developers can now avail themselves of the benefits and advantages of object technology. UML is a 3rd generation modeling language which rigorously defines the semantics of the object metamodel and provides a notation for capturing and communicating object structure and behavior. It is particularly well-suited to modeling real-time and embedded systems.Real-Time UML is the introduction that developers of real-time systems need to make the transition to object-oriented analysis and design and modeling with UML.  It covers the important features of the UML and shows how to effectively use the UML to model real-time systems. The book includes special in-depth discussions of finite state machines, object identification strategies, and real-time design patterns to help beginning and experienced developers alike. 0201325799B04062001

Suitable for both the project manager and Visual Basic  developer, Jake Sturm''s Professional Visual Basic Project  Management is a clear-eyed guide to enterprise-level project  management using Visual Basic 6 and UML. It provides a digestible and  intelligent mix of advice and design expertise that can bring your  organization up to speed with today''s VB and the Microsoft  platform.
 The book offers a notable mix of practical advice for the  project manager with some nuts-and-bolts technical detail on such  topics as components, UML, and Microsoft tools like Microsoft  Transaction Server (MTS). Like most books on software development,  this text walks the reader through the software lifecycle (organized  here into the envisionment, design, development, and deployment  phases). Along the way, the author''s clear style and tips for  successful management help make this tour a successful one. 
  Standout sections include the book''s details on managing meetings and  the sample documents (such as budgets and project schedules) created  with Project 98. You''ll also appreciate the breakdown of the various  players in the development effort (from project and component managers  to end users and corporate stakeholders) and the changing roles they  play during the project lifecycle.
 Along the way, the author shows  off some of the latest thinking about VB used on the Microsoft  platform, with coverage of business objects, transactions, MTS, and  even Web interfaces created with ASPs. UML is used throughout the book  as part of the design process (including class, activity, and sequence  diagrams).
 While there''s certainly no substitute for real project  management experience, with its mix of accessibility and technical  detail this book can give any VB project manager some valuable extra  help for taking on the challenges of today''s enterprise  development. --Richard Dragan

For the several million developers using "traditional" Visual Basic 6, Microsoft Visual Basic .NET Step by Step will put the new VB .NET within reach with a very approachable tour of the new version''s features used to build traditional client-side software. If you''ve been put off by the newfangled books on .NET that spin the new VB as Internet-focused and unrelated to your existing expertise, this title shows you how to leverage your knowledge to get going with Microsoft''s newest platform.
The salient feature of this text is the author''s patient presentation style, which stresses "traditional" VB programming. (While VB 6 did technically support Web programming, the unarguable reality is that most developers have built form-based programs for years.) This volume shows you how to use the same techniques for the new VB .NET. The author begins his presentation here with a clever slot-machine application to get you started. Other early sections cover the basics of VB .NET from a language perspective, including basics like variables, data types, and flow control statements. This handsomely printed volume makes use of two-toned color (in blue) to highlight differences between VB 6 in VB .NET, making it an invaluable resource for programmers making this transition.
Other essential technologies get their due here as well, from basic control programming with Windows Forms, integrating with ActiveX controls, to a very approachable guide to the new ADO.NET APIs for databases. Coverage of how to bind data to a variety of controls, plus using the new VB .NET DataGrid control, will show you how to do all you did in VB 6 in the new .NET. Instead of getting bogged down in details, the author does a good job of presenting what working programmers need to know. Later chapters delve into .NET APIs for working with files, strings, and collections. This title doesn''t pretend to cover ASP.NET in any detail, though there is a useful introduction to the subject, as well as how to use the Microsoft Internet Explorer Object to build VB applications that display HTML and other Internet content.
The reality is that most VB 6 programmers will have to learn a lot when it comes to .NET. Before launching into a whole new paradigm of Web development, this book shows that today''s VB has a lot to do with the older VB 6 standard. This text will be nearly indispensable for any VB 6 programmers making the leap to .NET. It even suggests that rumors of the death of the traditional client-side VB application may be somewhat exaggerated. This title shows you that the new easier deployment and productivity features of VB .NET may extend the life of such applications in one of the best-available tutorials for learning VB .NET, bar none. --Richard DraganProduct Description

Ideal for any project manager or developer working in Visual Basic, Upgrading Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 to Microsoft Visual Basic .NET delivers an admirably lucid and valuable guide to porting legacy VB code to the new .NET framework. This book offers some indispensable advice on making this transition go smoothly.
    The text is notable for its clear-sighted presentation style, useful for both project managers (who must plan when to upgrade code) and working VB developers (who must cope with a host of new APIs and language changes in VB .NET). The authors first establish the reasons why Microsoft chose to break literally millions of lines of code with the new .NET. They explore old and new VB languages and pay attention to features that have been dropped in the new version.
    The heart of this text examines the Visual Basic .NET Upgrade Wizard in excellent detail, starting with a simple VB6 project upgraded to VB .NET. As the authors suggest, the wizard handles 95 percent of the port to .NET for your VB code. Much of the text explains what do about the remaining 5 percent of features that don''t make the cut. One standout chapter here looks at which VB6 systems to upgrade first. (Not every legacy system will need to be upgraded, the authors prudently observe.) Another valuable section examines the "errors, warnings and issues" generated by the upgrade wizard, with specific suggestions on how to rewrite code that isn''t translated automatically.
    Later chapters look at specific areas of .NET that can "add value" to your projects, including the advantages of ADO.NET and Windows Forms versus the older ADO and ActiveX standards. There''s plenty of useful advice for getting the old and new VB to interoperate, too, notably using ActiveX, COM, and COM+ controls within .NET (a perfectly acceptable strategy). Final reference sections list changes between VB6 and VB .NET, highlighting which language features are no longer supported.
    Sanctioned by Microsoft Press, this title gives you the proverbial inside track on upgrading VB6 to VB .NET in an admirably well-organized text that''s filled with practical advice. With millions of VB developers out there facing .NET for the first time, this title provides a worthy resource for moving old code into the future as smoothly and as cheaply as possible. --Richard Dragan

Former director of the Well, recent consultant to America  Online, and current director of community development for Salon  Magazine, Figallo knows what it takes to create a true community  in cyberspace and what kinds of mistakes will torpedo the  effort. Figallo believes that community comes from people, and so he  begins by focusing on the human element. He writes about the groups  that form online communities and how a community builder can foster  the process. Figallo includes a great section on building a quality  online staff. While he keeps technical aspects in perspective, Figallo  doesn''t shortchange them--he fully discusses types of interfaces and  technical tools.
 Figallo''s discussion of the business side of a  community is refreshingly hype-free. He provides excellent information  on revenue models and support strategies. He further shows the  advantages businesses can gain from creating or supporting online  communities, plus what types of expectations are unrealistic. He  believes, for example, that creating online communities is not a  reasonable way to directly boost sales or provide a highly profitable  income stream. He does show, however, that it can offer major  corporate advantages in the same way that good public relations or  other indirect marketing activities do. And while Figallo never claims  that there''s an easy formula for building the type of online feeling  that brings people back again and again, he demonstrates with both  theory and real-world examples how dedicated community builders can  pull it off. --Elizabeth LewisProduct Description

This boxed set helps you prepare for the four examinations you must pass   to qualify as a Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) under the Windows   2000 curriculum. You''ll find lots of information on Windows 2000 and its   networking capabilities in this kit; specifically, it comprises four books   (Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Active   Directory Services, and Network Infrastructure Administration) and a   CD-ROM (a 120-day evaluation version of Windows 2000 Server). 
    This kit is among the first Windows 2000 MCSE packages on the market, and the   books are rather accurate and detailed; they''re written mostly by Microsoft   internal documentation staff, so they use a standard formula. Each module begins   with a statement of concepts and facts, such as what a log file is, and what   each of the three Windows 2000 log files is for. Then, you get how-to   information in the form of stepped procedures for viewing log contents. Option   tables come next, as well as other material that explains how to deal with   nonstandard situations. Finally, carefully scripted exercises allow you to   practice your new skills and get predictable results.
    Sections on Domain Name Service (DNS), the IPsec protocol, and the management of   network protocols are particularly good. As you might expect from a training kit   on a product whose main new feature is Active Directory, the coverage of Active   Directory services is top-drawer. Concepts, as well as practicalities, get their   due. If only the CD-ROM included a copy of Windows 2000 Professional, so that   you could set up an experimental network.
    The CD-ROM ought to include also an exam simulator; more test-prep material in   the bodies of the books themselves would have been nice, too. As they stand,   they''re fine tutorials and references, but not great test-preparation aids. Each   chapter includes review questions that allow a free response instead of a   selection from a list of options. The questions will test your knowledge, and   answer keys do appear in appendices, but they don''t simulate the multiple-choice   format of the actual MCSE exams. Read these books for the information they   contain, but wait for an Exam Cram or other question repository to get   simulation tests. --David Wall
Topics covered: The Microsoft-published objectives of the four required   Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) exams; specifically, material on the   Windows 2000 Server (70-215), Windows 2000 Professional (70-210), Network   Infrastructure Administration (70-216), and Active Directory Services (70-217)   exams.

Perl tends to be talked about as a cross between a religion and a programming language. It has a lot going for it: in particular, it''s free and available on most platforms. ActivePerl is Perl implemented as an ActiveX component, enabling its use as an ASP scripting language for IIS. Using ActivePerl rather than Perl with CGI takes up fewer server resources.
ActivePerl with ASP and ADO is aimed at Windows developers, though it isn''t obvious why they''d want to use Perl rather than Microsoft''s native VBScript. This text explains the basics of the Perl language, along with ASP and ADO, but you really need more than this book if you''re going to realize the full power of Perl as an ASP-scripting language.
    On the ASP side, the book provides good explanations of how and why things happen and how to make them happen the way you want them to. It discusses statefulness and cookies, along with simple ASP pages and database connectivity. The text discusses ADO usage in depth--including such esoterica as converting between ActivePerl scripts and command-line Perl for more efficient client-data presentations.
    The book ends with the Record object, a hierarchical data structure, followed by appendices--which include a collection of useful scripts. ActivePerl and all the code is on the companion CD-ROM.
ActivePerl with ASP and ADO is authoritative and its author is clearly an expert, but pity the poor beginner who has to master all three languages at once. Despite the roller-coaster ride, the book is well structured and provides a concise source for Windows developers looking to move to a more powerful scripting language. --Steve Patient, Amazon.co.ukProduct Description
A programmer''s guide to creating faster, more robust, interactive Web pages using PerlScriptPerlScript is an emerging scripting language that lets UNIX programmers write easy code for powerful and hot new Microsoft technologies such as Active Server Pages (ASP). Like JavaScript or VBScript, PerlScript is a "lite" version of a full-fledged programming language. Both Perl and VBScript programmers will benefit from the move to PerlScript because it provides cost benefits, superior power, and speed. This book provides a no-filler tutorial on PerlScript with plenty of concise examples that focus on using Active Server Pages (ASP) objects, and ActiveX Data Objects (ADO). It gives programmers the exact syntax for methods, properties, setting properties, database programming, collections, and data retrieval. CD-ROM contains ActivePerl plus all examples and scripts from the book.

Still, they know the product well (one of them helped develop it), and the material in the book will be useful to anyone who needs to figure out how to make BizTalk work.
    The approach in BizTalk is typically Wroxian in the sense that the presentation consists mainly of text, punctuated by lots of code listings and conceptual diagrams. A fictional case study threads throughout; Bob''s Bolts serves as a recurring illustrative tool, providing a framework for specific instructions on what to do (in terms of interface manipulation and coding) to meet various requirements. The book emphasizes that BizTalk is a tool for facilitating commerce, and business considerations are thoroughly discussed as engineering decisions are explained. It''s the sort of reasoning that real-world BizTalk consultants will have to keep in mind. --David Wall
Topics covered:Microsoft BizTalk Server 2000 and its related technologies XML Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Microsoft Message Queuing (MSMQ) The XLANG scheduling language Messaging Field mapping Functoid creation Application integration The routing and tracking of messagesProduct Description
The BizTalk(tm) Framework is an XML framework for application integration and electronic commerce. Microsoft''s BizTalk Server 2000 runs on Windows 2000 Server and is capable of integrating with delimited and positional flat file formats, EDI documents, and XML. It allows you to perform the three tasks critical in enterprise application integration: design the flow of information through a system, use BizTalk and its interfaces as the glue to perform the actual integration, then track the flow of information through the resulting system. It does this by providing the integration code in a central server, removing the need for writing integration code into programs, and does much of this by configuration of the server, reducing the amount of time you need to spend programming the integration code.
  This book teaches you how to use BizTalk Server as an Enterprise Application Integration tool, to integrate applications into co-operating systems. It is especially suited to rapid deployment B2B and B2C e-commerce applications, where you need to integrate with legacy applications.

Inside XML is an intelligent and easy-to-follow guide to today''s proliferating XML standards. Aside from being a road map to the latest and greatest in what''s on the horizon with XML, this book gives you what you need to know to be productive with existing XML tools right now. 
    The tour begins with an introduction to the XML used in real-world applications (like the Chemical Markup Language, CML, and the Vector Markup Language, VML [for graphics]). While many books give you the basics, this one excels at explaining the conventions of designing robust XML document types in detail. With dozens of short examples, you''ll learn XML conventions thoroughly, including some of the best practices for creating readable, maintainable content. The author highlights certain lines of XML code, so it''s easier to see what''s important.
    After 200 pages of in-depth material on how to design XML documents, the book turns to using XML in actual browsers (both in Netscape and Internet Explorer). This practical focus means that you get to explore available Microsoft tools and how they sometimes differ from official W3C standards.
    Subsequent sections turn to related XML standards, like XLinks and XPointers. Each section lists Web links to the latest online documents, but the emphasis isn''t on theory so much as on what you can do right now. You''ll learn how to use Java with XML, including navigating the XML Document Object Model (DOM) using IBM''s XML for Java (XML4J) package. The tutorial explaining the Simple API for XML (SAX) does a great job of explaining the advantages of this popular tool. 
    Final chapters delve into displaying XML with several existing standards, including XHTML (for Web browser content), VML (for drawing shapes), and the Resource Description Framework (RDF) for allowing XML-based content searching. Final sections look at combining XML with Perl and Java (through servlets and JSPs) and give a glimpse at wireless content created with the Wireless Markup Language (WML).
    Suitable for any developer or IT manager who needs to understand and use XML, Inside XML provides an authoritative yet approachable source of information on a fast-changing set of standards that are almost sure to revolutionize computing over the next few years. --Richard Dragan

The XML explosion hardly needs any introduction-it''s everywhere and there just seems to be no end to what can be done with XML. While writing to the W3C standards, and keeping up with the pace for corporate implementation, you, the programmer or web developer, will need a comprehensive guide to get you started and show you what XML and its related technologies can do. A thorough guide is imperative to success because you will need to know and understand the full scope of XML from day one in order to work with it successfully. With your time constraints and impossible project schedules, you need a comprehensive guide that fulfills your needs in one complete book. Inside XML is an anchor book that covers both the Microsoft and non-Microsoft approach to XML programming. It covers in detail the hot aspects of XML; such as, DTD''s vs. XML Schemas, CSS, XSL, XSLT, Xlinks, Xpointers, XHTML, RDF, CDF, parsing XML in Perl and Java, and much more.

In addition to being a tutorial for learning how to use XML as an effective way to represent and transmit data across the Web, Professional XML Databases also covers how to work with XML in the current generation of Microsoft tools, like Internet Explorer and SQL Server 2000. For any developer or manager who works with databases on the Windows platform, this book shows how you can delve into XML today for real projects.
    With endorsements from virtually every major vendor (including Microsoft), XML looks to be a compelling standard for sharing corporate data between organizations. Professional XML Databases examines how to integrate XML into your organization''s database infrastructure. Early sections concentrate on the rules and strategies for designing effective XML documents (DTDs) that mimic traditional tables (including links between tables). By providing almost a dozen rules on how to do this correctly, the book assures that you''ll learn not only the basics of XML syntax but also the correct way to create DTDs that are efficient, easy to maintain, and readable across your business. (Further sections reverse this process and show you how to create database tables based on XML.)
    Subsequent sections cover many of the standards and APIs in today''s XML, from XML Schemas, the XML W3C Document Object Model (DOM), and the Simple API for XML (SAX), to related standards like XSLT, XPath, and XPointer. A number of books cover these APIs, but this one provides a unique focus by examining Microsoft tools and their support for XML. This means there is coverage of Microsoft ADO (and ADO+, now called ADO.NET) for querying databases and packaging the results as XML. Sections on SQL Server 2000 highlight ways to use XML in this product, both as results and through XML views.
    Closing sections explore options for working with XML for data warehousing and transmitting data efficiently across organizations. Sections on Java and the DB Prism (an open-source XML framework) help give this book a perspective that extends beyond the Microsoft platform.
    For any database developer or designer who needs to architect XML documents in order to share data in real projects, this advanced treatise on the right way to define and use XML will prove highly valuable. For anyone who uses SQL Server 2000, this book also points the way toward using XML standards in actual shipping products on the Microsoft platform. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered:Hints for effective XML document design (including XML for text and XML for databases) Designing XML for existing database tables Creating database tables from XML Standards guidelines for XML used within (and between) organizations XML Schemas The XML W3C Document Object Model (DOM) Using the Simple API for XML (SAX) XSLT XPath used with style sheets and templates Resource linking with XLink Overview of additional emerging XML-based standards (including XBase, XInclude, XHTML, and XForms) The XML Query language Converting between flat file databases and XML Introduction to Microsoft ADO, ADO+ (ADO.NET), and XML Storing and retrieving XML in SQL Server 2000 (including OPENXML and XML views) Tutorial for JDBC programming JDBC used with XML Data warehousing Data transmission with XML The Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Marshalling and presentation with XML (including a WML example for generating wireless content) Sample case studies for SQL Server 2000 showing XML techniques DB Prism (an open-source dynamic XML framework) XML and database primers References for XML datatypes and SAXProduct Description
: In this book, we look at how to integrate XML into your current relational data source strategies. With the increasing amount of data stored in relational databases, and the importance of XML as a format for marking up data - whether it be for storage, display, interchange, or processing - you need to have command of four key skills: understanding how to structure, process, access, and store your data.
  By introducing guidelines for how to model your XML documents in relational databases and how to model relational database information as XML, we will establish structures that enable quick and efficient access, and make our data more flexible. We then look at the developer''s XML toolbox, discussing associated technologies and strategies that will help us in describing, processing, and manipulating data. We also discuss common techniques for data access, data warehousing, transmission, and marshalling and presentation, giving working examples in every chapter.
  Whether you are using XML for storage, as an interchange format, or for display, this book looks at some of the key issues you should be aware of when structuring, processing, accessing, and storing your documents.

<h3 class="review">Product Description
</h3>: In this book, we look at how to integrate XML into your current relational data source strategies. With the increasing amount of data stored in relational databases, and the importance of XML as a format for marking up data - whether it be for storage, display, interchange, or processing - you need to have command of four key skills: understanding how to structure, process, access, and store your data.<P>  By introducing guidelines for how to model your XML documents in relational databases and how to model relational database information as XML, we will establish structures that enable quick and efficient access, and make our data more flexible. We then look at the developer''s XML toolbox, discussing associated technologies and strategies that will help us in describing, processing, and manipulating data. We also discuss common techniques for data access, data warehousing, transmission, and marshalling and presentation, giving working examples in every chapter.<P>  Whether you are using XML for storage, as an interchange format, or for display, this book looks at some of the key issues you should be aware of when structuring, processing, accessing, and storing your documents.

Sean McGrath makes understanding XML simple by gently easing  his readers into the topic. His overview discusses what XML is and how  it differs philosophically from HTML without competing with it. This  introduction shows why XML is generating such excitement and how it  will be of great importance to electronic commerce.
 Next, McGrath  demonstrates XML in action in an electronic-commerce environment. His  conversational style leads the reader through what could be very dry  topics, such as publishing databases with XML or using Channel  Definition Format (CDF) to create a push-publishing channel. His  friendly tone is all the handier in the section that examines XML and  related standards.
 The final section looks at three e-commerce  initiatives based on XML--Open Financial Exchange, Electronic Data  Exchange, and Open Trading Protocol. An enclosed CD-ROM contains an  excellent collection of XML e-commerce development tools and useful  reference material. The book''s editor, Charles Goldfarb, is the  developer of SGML, the parent mark-up language upon which XML is  based. --Elizabeth LewisProduct Description

Beginning XML provides a complete course in the Extensible Markup   Language (XML) with an unusually gradual learning curve. In fact, the   introduction states that the book is "for people who know that it would be a   pretty good idea to learn the language, but aren''t 100 percent sure why."   Despite its recognition of the fuzziness of readers'' understanding of the   technology, the book delivers a rather comprehensive study of XML.
    Very little space is wasted detailing the history of XML and its relation to   SGML, as is the case in many other titles. The argument for the importance of   XML is made quickly, and the basics of well-formed syntax are tackled right off.   One notable distinction of this book is its excellent coverage of related   technologies, such as cascading style sheets (CSS) and relational databases.
    In addition to discussing the crucial companion standards to the core XML   language (DTDs, XSL, and XSLT), the book adds a nice perspective to the broad   range of applications in which XML can play a role. One section, "Other Uses for   XML," illustrates how XML can be used to serialize object models, creating   stateless objects and utilizing the Resource Description Framework (RDF). Case   studies on--among other things--how XML can be used to build discussion groups,   and provide B2B data transfer, round out the text. This book is perfect for Web   programmers who are turning their attention to XML for the first time. It   imparts a solid understanding of the XML forest and XML trees. --Stephen W.   Plain

  Understanding SOAP begins with a discussion of distributed object computing, reviewing the current technologies. It then discusses the realities that make distributed object computing so difficult. Given these realities, the book provides a case study of a current technology to show why it is so difficult to distribute objects and why a protocol, such as SOAP, is such an important topic. An in-depth example gives you a working scenario of what is involved with distributed object computing and SOAP. Finally, the book discusses the future of SOAP, to include language binding and system integration. This book provides you with an accelerated approach to understanding how XML applies to distributed systems, specifically using the SOAP protocol.

The unexpected pleasure of reading books about databases is that they are often written by authors with highly organized minds. Paul DuBois and his editors at New Riders have assembled MySQL with a clarity and lucidity that inspires confidence in the subject matter: a (nearly) freely redistributable SQL-interpreting database client/server primarily geared for Unix systems but maintained for Windows platforms as well. What isn''t "free" about MySQL (the application) is its server''s commercial use; all clients and noncommercial server use are free. DuBois''s tome isn''t free either, but its list price is modest in light of its value and the value of its namesake.
 The volume is superbly organized into 12 chapters and 10 appendices and contains a concise table of contents and a comprehensive 50-page index. It is peppered with references to the online HTML documentation that comes with the source and binary distributions (which are available and easy to install in stable rpm and tar releases.)
 The first third of MySQL is an excellent instruction tool for database newbies; the second third is a detailed reference for MySQL developers; and the last third consists of clearly annotated appendices, including C, Perl (but not Python), and PHP interfaces. 
 Perhaps as an indication of the collective will of the developers of MySQL, DuBois does not separate Windows 95/98/NT design or development specifics from its main discussions. Platform-independent design is a goal, not a reality, and users will have to rely on newsgroups and mailing lists for details. Moreover, security issues are addressed in a mere 18 pages, a large part of which is devoted to standard Unix file and network-access permissions. Next to nothing is mentioned about defense against common hacking strategies, the use of secure shell interfaces, or access encryption.
 Although it is nearly 800 pages in length, DuBois''s book is thankfully not encyclopedic. It is a valuable précis of the MySQL database, and its easy-to-skim look and feel will make it an excellent browse for database experts who want to know what is and is not possible within MySQL, the application. --Peter LeopoldProduct Description
  In MySQL, Paul DuBois provides you with a comprehensive guide to one of the most popular relational database systems. As an important contributor to the online documentation for MySQL, Paul uses his day-to-day experience answering questions users post on the MySQL mailing list to pinpoint the problems most users and administrators encounter. The principal MySQL developer, Monty Widenius, along with a network of his fellow developers, reviewed the manuscript, providing Paul with the kind of insight no one else could supply. Instead of merely giving you a general overview of MySQL, Paul teaches you how to make the most of its capabilities. Through two sample databases that run throughout the book, he gives you solutions to problems you''ll likely face. He helps you integrate MySQL efficiently with third-party tools, such as PHP and Perl, enabling you to generate dynamic Web pages through database queries. He also teaches you to write programs that access MySQL databases.

In the SQL database community, Joe Celko is a well-known  columnist and purveyor of valuable insights. In Joe Celko''s SQL for  Smarties: Advanced SQL Programming, he picks up where basic SQL  training and experience leaves many database professionals and offers  tips, techniques, and explanations that help readers extend their  capabilities to top-tier SQL programming.
 Although Celko denies  that the book is about database theory, he nevertheless alludes to  theory often to buttress his practical points. This title is not for  novices, as the author points out. Instead, its intended audience is  SQL programmers with at least a year''s experience. The book maintains  a fine balance between technical discussion and practical  explanation--picking hot topics and offering advice on a wide range of  issues.
 The book uses ANSI SQL-89 as its baseline standard, with  some mention of SQL-92 features. It does not, however, focus on any  commercial product; this guide zeroes in on the SQL language. Celko  covers all aspects of database design, optimization, and manipulation,  with easy-to-understand explanations of key issues such as why not to  use too many nulls, how to use practical normalization, and how to  optimize queries. 
 This insightful text is manna for all the  day-to-day SQL coders banging their heads over the language''s subtle  challenges. --Stephen W. Plain
Topics covered:  Database design and normalization, SQL data types, querying, grouping,  set operations, optimization, data scaling, and encoding.

Product Description

SQL for Smarties was hailed as the first book devoted explicitly to the advanced techniques you need to transform yourself into an expert SQL programmer. Now, in this fully updated second edition, SQL mastermind Joe Celko keeps you moving forward, using his entertaining, conversational style to teach you the best solutions to old and new challenges and to convey the way you need to think if you really want to get the most out of your SQL programming efforts.
Inside, logic- and set-based analyses replace the traditional, procedural approach to problem-solving, helping you make the conceptual leap that separates an SQL guru from the rest of the pack. As you catch on to Celko''s approach, you''ll devour what he has to say about some of SQL''s toughest topics: how aggregate functions really work, the best way to work with NULLs, how and why to fake array structures, and much more.
This book gives special emphasis to SQL-92 and product-independent techniques that let you optimize performance or achieve highly specialized behavior, regardless of the RDBMS with which you work. If you''re serious about SQL, you won''t let SQL for Smarties out of your sight.* Presents all-new war stories that give you insight into real-world SQL programming challenges.* Continues to cover SQL-89 but focuses heavily on the SQL-92 standard.* Offers still more undocumented tips for working around system deficiencies.* Teaches scores of advanced techniques that can be used with any product, in any SQL environment.* Offers expert advice from a noted SQL authority and award-winning columnist.

This is one of the heaviest manuals in the SQL arena--in both weight and content. It is also one of the most   up-to-date SQL books around and one of the few to cover the most recent extensions of SQL, such as the   Call-Level Interface (SQL/CLI) and the Persistent Stored Modules feature (SQL/PSM). If you want to go   beyond the SQL92 standard, which is covered by most other SQL books,  then Date and Darwen''s manual   is for you. Arguably the most complete SQL guide, A Guide to the  SQL Standard contains   resources such as a full listing of SQL grammar, which is indispensable in tricky programming situations.   The Date and Darwen book does not assume that you are using any particular SQL dialect, so it can be used   with any standard SQL database. A beginner who picks up this book first is unlikely to learn much of   anything about SQL. But for information about obscure SQL commands or precise definitions of syntax,   there is no better place to turn.

If you want to go   beyond the SQL92 standard, which is covered by most other SQL books,  then Date and Darwen''s manual   is for you. Arguably the most complete SQL guide, <I>A Guide to the  SQL Standard</I> contains   resources such as a full listing of SQL grammar, which is indispensable in tricky programming situations.   The Date and Darwen book does not assume that you are using any particular SQL dialect, so it can be used   with any standard SQL database. A beginner who picks up this book first is unlikely to learn much of   anything about SQL. But for information about obscure SQL commands or precise definitions of syntax,   there is no better place to turn.

Web Development with JavaServer Pages is truly an excellent and   in-depth tutorial in the effective use of JSPs to build Web applications. Geared   toward the Web designer or intermediate Java programmer who''s making a   transition to JSPs for the first time, this text contains a wealth of   information on basic and advanced techniques.
    This tutorial is as good as any that''s available, and covers all of the   necessary JSP directives and syntax. For each directive, possible   attributes are listed in convenient tables, which makes this also a   worthwhile reference to everyday JSP development that explores the nooks and   crannies of JSP APIs, and how pages are built (and cached) on today''s JSP   platforms.
Web Development with JavaServer Pages also does a good job of showing how   to design JavaBean components and integrate them into your JSPs through tags.   (Ideally, beans should do the calculation and "thinking" on the middle tier,   while JSPs work on the front end.) You''ll learn the right way to proceed with   JSPs and beans--reinforced via a number of effective code samples. A larger   example, a Web database of frequently asked questions (FAQs), demonstrates the   big picture with JSPs and beans. Final chapters turn toward a useful aspect of   JSP, custom tags, which allow Java programmers to extend the set of available   tags for JSP front-end designers. There''s even a sample of interactive tags, in   which tags work together with other tags, with sample code.
    Filled with plenty of details that carry the reader well beyond the basics, this   text is one of the better available tutorials for learning JSPs. Its no-nonsense   presentation style and useful examples can help put JSP development into the   hands of anyone who has some prior HTML or Java experience. --Richard   Dragan

Dynamic content-personalized, customized, and up-to-the-minute-is a key component of site development on the World Wide Web today. Java Server Pages (JSP) is a new server-side technology for generating dynamic content in Web pages and other on-line applications. This guide to JSP covers all aspects of development and includes comparisons to similar dynamic content systems such as CGI, Active Server Pages, Cold Fusion, and PHP. Included is a discussion of the use of component centric design via Java Beans and custom tag libraries for separating the presentation of dynamic data (the layout, look, and feel) from its implementation (the code that generates it).

Your organizational database is only as good as the strategic data you can extract from it. Do customers who buy breakfast cereal typically buy bananas as well? Is there a correlation between rainfall in a particular region and the prevalence of a particular illness there? Data Mining with Microsoft SQL Server 2000 Technical Reference shows how to use Microsoft''s analysis tools for large databases. Author Claude Seidman offers advice on the data-modeling engineering process as a whole, including designing strategies likely to yield meaningful results, designing data warehouses, growing decision trees, spotting clusters and anomalies in data, and automating mining processes with code.
    Despite its designation as a reference, this book is largely a tutorial--you''ll refer to it for advice on how to make Analysis Services do something in particular. Seidman uses a classic and effective tutorial technique, sticking with an example throughout the book and adding to previous examples as he explores additional aspects of Microsoft data mining. His illustration involves identifying edible mushrooms, based on a database of facts about known mushrooms, and he''s combined how-to prose with screen shots and accumulated wisdom to great effect. If your organization has gone with Microsoft SQL Server 2000 for data storage, read this book for advice on knowledge extraction. --David Wall
Topics covered: Microsoft Analysis Services, including the proper use of Data Transformation Services (DTS), PivotTable Services, Decision Support Objects (DSO), and the Microsoft implementation of On-Line Analytical Processing (OLAP).

Thoroughly enhanced for the EJB 1.1 specification, Enterprise JavaBeans, 2nd Edition provides a great introduction to the world of server-side Java components. With plenty of material on EJB architecture and design, this new edition can serve as an authoritative resource for mastering today''s bean standards.
 Besides a general introduction to EJBs, the new edition of this book excels at highlighting the differences between the EJB 1.0 and 1.1 standards. Sample code is provided for both versions. For deployment, EJB 1.1 now relies on XML to define all bean resources and dependencies. For every sample bean, the author provides the XML, as well as the old-style Java code for EJB 1.0. There''s also plenty of coverage of the new reliance on JNDI (the Java directory service) in EJB 1.1 and other late-breaking Sun standards, such as combining EJBs with servlets and JSPs for delivering dynamic Web content.
 This text is organized as a tutorial to the major types of EJBs with full coverage of entity beans (for accessing databases) and session beans (for managing "conversations" with particular clients). The author covers all the bases here with numerous diagrams describing the life cycle of beans and how they cooperate with today''s application servers. As in the first edition, sample beans for a cruise ship booking application let you see actual EJB code in action. Helpful appendices list all EJB APIs and other useful information (such as a list of current EJB vendors).
 In all, the revised edition of Enterprise JavaBeans shows off the considerable strengths of the new EJB 1.1 standard. Suitable for any working Java programmer or IT manager, the clear presentation of the strategies and techniques for successful component design help make this book a smart choice for successful development with EJBs. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Overview of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) v. 1.1 and 1.0, distributed objects, Component Transaction Monitors (CTMs), application servers and EJBs, resource management, EJB server setup, entity beans, session beans and workflow, the JNDI naming service, the life cycle of beans, container-managed and bean-managed persistence for entity beans, stateful and stateless session beans, deploying beans in JAR files (EJB 1.1 and 1.0 conventions), XML deployment descriptors, transaction basics (ACID properties and JTS), EJB security, design strategies and performance tips for EJBs, Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) and EJBs, servlets and JSPs used with EJBs, sample beans, state and sequence diagrams for EJBs, and EJB API reference.

Product Description
Enterprise JavaBeans (versions 1.1 and 1.0) is an important technology for  server-side application development in Java. It offers a component  architecture for developing distributed, multitiered enterprise applications.  This book provides a thorough introduction to EJB 1.1 and 1.0 for the  enterprise software developer. It shows you how to develop enterprise Beans  to model your business objects and processes. One powerful advantage of  the EJB architecture is that it allows you to partition work appropriately  between different parts of the system: the database provides persistence,  your Beans model various business entities and the interactions between them,  and your client application provides a user interface, but incorporates  minimal business logic. The end result is a highly flexible system built  from components that can easily be reused, and that can be changed to  suit your needs without upsetting other parts of the system.  Enterprise JavaBeans, 2nd Edition will help you take advantage of  the flexibility and simplicity that this powerful new architecture provides.

By making the seemingly complex world of C++  digestible in daily doses, Liberty delivers a tutorial that keeps you  motivated and yields serious results.
 This book uses a  chapter-a-day approach, with the course outline clearly presented  inside the front cover so you''ll know exactly where you''re  headed. Unlike many C++ tutorials, this book doesn''t put you to sleep  early on with object-oriented programming (OOP) theory. Instead, it  quickly makes you productive with the basics of the C++ language and  then reinforces your new knowledge with OOP as you move through the  teaching program.
 The first week introduces you to the  fundamentals: the anatomy of a C++ program, variables, expressions,  functions, program flow, and the basics of classes. Week two  introduces some of the more sophisticated elements of the language  such as pointers, arrays, and function overloading in a clear and  effective manner. The final week concludes your crash course with  advanced topics: streams, advanced inheritance, the C++ pre-processor,  templates, and error handling. One day is also devoted strictly to  object-oriented analysis and design. Each chapter finishes with a  daily summary, a Q&A section, a quiz, and a series of excellent coding  exercises.
 This tutorial, which is designed to teach you to write  industry standard ANSI C++ code, requires no previous programming  expertise. If you want to get serious with C++ in a hurry, this book  is an excellent way to go.

The biggest challenge and opportunity for IS departments approaching Windows 2000 is probably Active Directory (AD), which can reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) and simplify administration. For any IS professional or administrator, Windows 2000 Active Directory Survival Guide provides both a high-level introduction and a hands-on guide to transitioning to Windows 2000 successfully.
 The standout feature here is a thorough discussion of the right way to model organizations using Windows 2000 Active Directory (AD) in terms of domains, trees, forests, and organization units (OUs). More than ever, a proper model of your organization''s structure is critical for efficient, maintainable network infrastructure with Windows 2000.	This book shows clearly what works and what doesn''t. The author also provides the details of underlying standards, like DNS, Dynamic DNS, LDAP, and NDS and their relation to Active Directory. Each chapter includes a "Best Practices" section with many useful tips on planning and implementing your organization''s Windows 2000 network and server infrastructure.
 After the planning stages, the book turns to hands-on examples of upgrading and administering Windows 2000, with plenty of screenshots of the actual tools like the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and Active Directory wizards. Notable material here discusses how to upgrade from Windows NT successfully (and how to let NT 4.0 coexist with Windows 2000 for those who require this option). Besides all the basics, the author shows how to take advantage of group policies and delegation, which can significantly lower costs by standardizing the corporate desktop and spreading administrative responsibilities across the enterprise.	
 In all, with its inside-and-out tour of the Active Directory and solid guide to the nuts and bolts of common administrative tasks, Windows 2000 Active Directory Survival Guide is an excellent resource. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Active Directory (AD) overview and architecture, LDAP, NDS, X.500 standards, domains and domain controllers, DNS architecture, host names and name resolution, Dynamic DNS, trust relationships, namespaces, organization units (OUs), trees, forests, global catalog servers, replication, security and ACLs, Windows 2000 security, organization models, naming strategies, replication, Microsoft Management Console (MMC) and snap-ins, group policy, ADSI, and upgrading to Windows 2000.

Software developers are supposed to work insane hours, drink only caffeinated beverages, and have no personal lives, all in the interest of shipping the all-important Product. In the popular consciousness, the desperate programming team has acquired a status similar to that of the movie protagonist drinking whiskey alone at a bar--both are examples of ritual self-abuse deemed heroic. In After the Gold Rush: Creating a True Profession of Software Engineering, Steve McConnell argues that the methodical abuse of programmers causes bad code, unhappy people, and reduced profitability in the long run. In place of the existing system of crazy deadlines, clueless marketing, and scattershot programming strategies, McConnell proposes making software engineering into a "true profession." Such a profession would have a well-defined body of core knowledge, a system of professional certifications, and a code of professional ethics.
 The question of whether such a "professionalization" of software development is a good idea is up for debate, certainly. It seems that a lot of programming jobs involve standard problems and solutions, which would lend themselves to teaching and testing. On the other hand, quantum-leap innovation has often come from "cowboy" artisans who deviate from the standard practices. Similarly, aggressive technology investors aren''t interested in deliberate, standardized work--they want world-beating products (and they want them to market immediately, if not sooner). After the Gold Rush makes a well-reasoned, well-supported argument for a more structured programming profession, and is worthwhile reading for any technology executive or project manager. --David Wall
Topics covered: The problem with "code-and-fix" software development, the elusive nature of a body of knowledge in high-tech subjects, the structure of more traditional engineering professions (civil, chemical, and others), solution design versus implementation, and suggestions for how software engineering professionals might get trained and certified.

Product Description
In this newest addition to Microsoft Press''s acclaimed BEST PRACTICES series, award-winning author Steve McConnell offers candid reflections upon and a look ahead at the software engineering profession from one of the industry''s most highly regarded practitioners. AFTER THE GOLD RUSH is a collection of illuminating original essays on contemporary software development topics that highlight critical trends and call for a more rigorous and standards-based profession. McConnell delivers a lively and provocative narrative that aims to help software developers step back from the day-to-day rush of their work and think about where their careers-and the industry they''re helping to shape-are going.

I can hear some of you exclaiming, "How can you possibly  recommend a book about software scheduling published by Microsoft  Press and written by a consultant to Microsoft?!" Well, put aside any  preconceived biases. This is a tremendous book on effective scheduling  software development, and it drinks deeply from the wisdom of all the  classics in the field such as Brook''s Mythical  Man Month -- and is likely well-informed by McConnell''s  experiences, good and bad, in Redmond.  
  The nine page section entitled "Classic Mistakes Enumerated" is alone  worth the price of admission and should be required reading for all  developers, leads, and managers. Here are some types of the 36 classic  mistakes that McConnell describes in detail:  
People Related Mistakes  Heroics  Adding people to a late project  Politics placed over substance (etc.)  Process Related Mistakes  Abandonment of planning under pressure  Planning to catch up later  "Code-like-hell" programming (etc.)  Technology Related MistakesSilver-Bullet syndrome  Overestimating savings from new tools or methods  Switching tools in the middle of a project (etc.)  
  I suspect that if you''ve ever been involved in software development,  you winced after reading each of these nine points. And you will learn  a great deal from the remaining 640 pages about concrete solutions.  
  My only substantive gripe: cheesy Powerpoint graphics. Nonetheless,  this book is Very Highly Recommended.

This classic work shows a care and understanding of C++ that  only Bjarne Stroustrup, the designer of the language, can achieve. It  also conveys the punctilious and sometimes suffocating detail that  only Stroustrup would desire to communicate. The novice programmer  will have difficulty distinguishing between the essential and the  dispensable material. However, experienced C++ programmers will  appreciate the reference manual portion of the book, which contains an  exact definition of C++ that even numerous examples cannot  express. Stroustrup''s book has several chapters on classes and the  reference manual component of the book contains the complete grammar  of classes. This is a book that every experienced C++ programmer needs  to own.

Product Description
The second edition reflects the changes that have occurred as the C++ language has grown and developed over the last five years. This definitive guide, written by the designer of C++, now provides coverage of all of the features available in the most recent release, including multiple inheritance, typesafe linkage, and abstract classes. Includes two new chapters on how to design C++ programs.

In 160 pages of expert instruction, authors Patrick J. Lynch  and Sarah Horton put the essence of the Yale University Center for  Advanced Instructional Media''s wonderful online site design guide into  traditional print.
 The book begins the presentation of its helpful  and forward-looking advice with a discussion of the overall process of  defining the objectives and users of your Web site, as well as the  goals you will use to measure your progress. The authors then use  time-tested, traditional print concepts to clearly illustrate how to  make your site interface welcoming and efficient. High-quality  illustrations show how to design for overall style and professional  appeal. The sections on typography and editorial style set this manual  apart from many Web style guides with attention to the fine details  that separate the good sites from the great.
 Multimedia elements  and cascading style sheets (CSS) are covered, but within the overall  context of building a fine site--not with the usual hype. Media  compression and delivery are addressed at a high level with concrete  suggestions on formats, frame rates, and image sizes for a  well-balanced approach to multimedia.
 One of the great things about  using this guide is that the actual site it is based on is  available. You can read about a thoughtfully-written topic and then go  online to see the concepts in action. Web Style Guide delivers  some of the most holistic coverage of site design you''ll  find. --Stephen W. PlainProduct Description

Aimed at readers with some basic knowledge of Java and XML, Java XML Programmer''s Reference provides an extremely useful reference and tutorial to virtually all of today''s common Java XML APIs and tools, including those used in the emerging world of Web services. Well organized and filled with useful tips and technical details for these often poorly documented tools, this book will earn a spot on many a working developer''s bookshelf.
Finding all of the XML APIs in one handy volume is the real reason to buy this reference work. In the fast-changing world of emerging XML tools and standards, many maintained by open-source organizations, it''s virtually impossible to keep up with the classes, APIs, and programming strategies needed to work with these tools. This book corrals the chaos with a lineup of the most popular and essential Java XML APIs, like the popular SAX and DOM standards. The authors also look at Sun''s new JAXP (and related bundles), which help standardize XML coding in Java.
Each API is documented by package, class, and method. Many entries have documented sample code showing off just how to use each API, which is a real   timesaver for any busy Java developer. While it''s possible to decipher open-source documents, you''ll save countless hours with this handy reference. Besides vendor-neutral APIs, the authors also tackle Oracle''s XSK for working with XML on that platform.
The second half of this book zeroes in on XML standards used in Web services, including WSDL and UDDI. Web services are illustrated here with a solid case study for an online auction example. Other samples include an   XML-based configuration with Ant, plus transforming content with XSLT for wireless user interfaces. There''s also coverage on "lightweight" XML for mobile devices. Sections on querying using SAX, DOM, and XPath 1.0 will help you search XML effectively.
While readers can obviously dig in to these later topics selectively, the main focus here on XML parsers and Web services will more than justify the price of this title for most readers. This book is quite simply a must-have for anyone combining Java and XML, undoubtedly two of today''s hottest computing technologies. --Richard DraganProduct Description
XML is rapidly becoming the standard representation format for data interchange, data verification, configuration, RDBMS interaction, remote procedure invocation, and the representation of transformation processes. In all these areas the Java language provides the programming interfaces and tools needed for driving the underlying machinery. 
  The intersection between Java and XML is wide-ranging, and the knowledge required to use them together effectively is expanding daily. The API section of this book provides quick access to the essential Java XML programming interfaces: SAX, DOM Core, DOM Extensions, JDOM, JAXP and TrAX, together with dozens of illustrative examples. The Tools section includes chapters on Oracle XDK, IBM Web Services Toolkit, Apache XML Project, XML tools for lightweight/mobile devices, and an overview of Sun early access XML projects, all packed with examples and reference material. The final Techniques section explores Java XML over five projects, developing a distributed business casestudy.

The Linux operating system has made a lot of progress in the past few years, and Running Linux has progressed right along with it to remain the single best general-purpose book for curious computer users who want to install, use, and enjoy Linux. The team of authors present a text that''s simultaneously detailed and readable. Coupled with an inquisitive and capable reader, that''s a recipe for success with the world''s most popular open-source operating system. This new edition adds coverage of the GNOME desktop environment, the Apache/MySQL/PHP server suite, and the Postfix mail transfer daemon. It also covers core capabilities and behaviors of Linux through kernel version 2.4. There''s better coverage of network security (including firewalling and ADSL link configuration), and coverage of how to set up audio-related hardware and software.
Perhaps best of all, this book conveys a sense of the "Linux attitude" as the authors see it. Linux, they say, is largely about experimentation, research, trial and error, and participation in a community. This comes in welcome contrast to books that focus on recipes (follow these steps to accomplish A; do these things to make your system do B). Though the authors of this book provide lots of how-to information, it''s always presented with an eye toward further exploration. In explaining how to build the kernel, for example, the authors provide six concise steps as a reference, but then go on for several pages about designing makefiles and how to deal with error messages. This book''s a treat. --David Wall
Topics covered: Assuming you know next to nothing about Linux, socially and historically as well as technically, this book teaches you what you need to know to make the operating system meet your desktop and server computing requirements. Coverage takes you from preparing to install Linux (in a multi-OS environment if you wish), continues through system administration and the most useful applications (like TeX and Internet clients), and proceeds to cover programming tools and server daemons (notably Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The coverage is mostly generic, but peculiarities of Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian get attention, too.

Product Description
Running Linux has everything you''ll need to understand, install, and start using Linux.  The authors, experienced Linux enthusiasts, have anticipated problem areas, selected stable and popular solutions, and provided clear discussions and instructions to ensure that you''ll have a satisfying experience using Linux. The discussion is direct and complete enough to guide novice users while still providing the additional information experienced users will need to progress in their mastery of Linux.  The fourth edition of Running Linux delves deeper into installation, configuring the windowing system, system administration, and networking. New topics include applications ready for prime time, basic security and firewalling, package management on Debian, sound configuration, ADSL, the GNOME desktop, the Postfix mail transfer agent, and the popular LAMP configuration that combines Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  A solid foundation text for any Linux user, the book also includes additional resources for dealing with special requirements imposed by hardware, advanced applications, and emerging technologies.

</h3>The Linux operating system has made a lot of progress in the past few years, and <I>Running Linux</I> has progressed right along with it to remain the single best general-purpose book for curious computer users who want to install, use, and enjoy Linux. The team of authors present a text that''s simultaneously detailed and readable. Coupled with an inquisitive and capable reader, that''s a recipe for success with the world''s most popular open-source operating system. This new edition adds coverage of the GNOME desktop environment, the Apache/MySQL/PHP server suite, and the Postfix mail transfer daemon. It also covers core capabilities and behaviors of Linux through kernel version 2.4. There''s better coverage of network security (including firewalling and ADSL link configuration), and coverage of how to set up audio-related hardware and software.<p>Perhaps best of all, this book conveys a sense of the "Linux attitude" as the authors see it. Linux, they say, is largely about experimentation, research, trial and error, and participation in a community. This comes in welcome contrast to books that focus on recipes (follow these steps to accomplish A; do these things to make your system do B). Though the authors of this book provide lots of how-to information, it''s always presented with an eye toward further exploration. In explaining how to build the kernel, for example, the authors provide six concise steps as a reference, but then go on for several pages about designing makefiles and how to deal with error messages. This book''s a treat. <I>--David Wall</I>  <p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Assuming you know next to nothing about Linux, socially and historically as well as technically, this book teaches you what you need to know to make the operating system meet your desktop and server computing requirements. Coverage takes you from preparing to install Linux (in a multi-OS environment if you wish), continues through system administration and the most useful applications (like TeX and Internet clients), and proceeds to cover programming tools and server daemons (notably Apache, MySQL, and PHP). The coverage is mostly generic, but peculiarities of Red Hat, SuSE, and Debian get attention, too.

This guide is appropriate for developers who want to use UML  with one of today''s most popular modeling tools: Rational Rose  4.0. The concise text gives a quick how-to tour of the most common  features of UML in the context of actual screen shots from the  Rational Rose package.
 This book begins with a short history of the  evolution of UML as well as the basic terms of software engineering,  including the incremental development as represented in the Rational  Objectory software-development process. 
 The rest of the book uses  a case study, developing a course registration system for a  hypothetical college, while illustrating the basic types of UML  diagrams in action. Each section uses plenty of screen shots to show  how to use UML in the actual Rational Rose modeling tool. After some  introductory requirements, the author walks the reader through the  steps required to design this course registration system, from use  cases (where the role of the users of the system is defined) and class  diagrams (where object-modeling techniques are used) and then on to  sequence diagrams (where the sequence of steps required to register  students is defined). Further chapters move toward defining an  architecture (how the system will be built and deployed in software  and hardware) and even refining the design within the incremental  methodology of Rational Rose.
 Generally, this sample case study is  just right--large enough to illustrate the interaction of design  elements, but not too large as to be unmanageable. Consider this title  if you lean toward hands-on materials. It covers a good deal of UML  details within the context of the Rational Rose tool. --Richard  DraganProduct Description
As software application development becomes more complex, the benefits of developing a comprehensive "blueprint" enabling developers to visualize the complete scope of a project increase substantially. Three elements are needed to successfully diagram and visualize a software system--a process, a notation, and a modeling tool. This timely new book introduces the reader to three of the most popular and influential such elements; the Rational Objectory process, the Unified Modeling Language (UML), and Rational Rose. With the practical direction offered in this book, you will be able to specify, visualize, document, and create software solutions.  Throughout the book, a simplified case study (a course registration system for a university) is employed to illustrate the analysis and design of an application. The presentation is structured to allow concentration on the specifics of modeling the domain without getting bogged down in unnecessary detail. This efficient approach to teaching visual modeling and the application of UML enables you to focus on learning to apply an iterative and incremental process to analysis and design.Other highlights include: *an examination of system behavior from a use case approach *a discussion of the concepts and notations used for finding objects and classes *an introduction to the concepts and notation needed to create and document a system''s architecture *a review of the iteration planning process 0201310163B04062001

Ralph Kimball''s The Data Warehouse Toolkit translates  the author''s extensive real-world design experience into a truly  useful guide to building data warehouses for today''s  corporations. Written in a no-nonsense prose style, the author gives  developers and managers the basics of designing, building, and running  data warehouses that are effective and useful to upper management.
  This book begins with the fundamentals of what data warehouses are and  how they differ from traditional databases used in online transaction  processing (OLTP). (Basically, data warehouses look at trends in  millions of database records drawn from across organizations.) Once  the author establishes this foundation, he solidly introduces the  issues of data-warehouse design, using samples drawn from a wide  variety of industries, including grocery stores, inventory warehouses,  shipping, financial services, cable TV subscriptions, insurance, and  travel. The author succinctly describes the relevant  "dimensions" of each industry. (These are the values or  features that management will most likely want to track for each  industry. The data warehouse must be prepared to answer these  "questions.")
 The last section of the book covers the  process of actually designing a data warehouse, from conducting user  interviews to planning for the hardware needed to run a data warehouse  (where databases easily run in gigabytes and include millions of  records). This text also includes a discussion of how to create  effective front ends for users (which will report the results of  data-warehouse queries).
 For its scope and intelligence, The  Data Warehouse Toolkit is required reading for any developer or  manager who wants to get a perspective on data warehouses before  building one. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Employing many real-life case studies of data warehouses, Ralph Kimball provides clear-cut guidelines on how to model data and design data warehouses to support advanced multidimensional decision support systems. With Kimball''s step-by-step instructions, readers will have mastered the full range of powerful techniques for creating, controlling and navigating dimensional business databases that are easy to understand and navigate.

Refactoring has proven its value in a wide range of development projects, helping software professionals improve system designs, maintainability, extensibility, and performance. Now, for the first time, leading agile methodologist Scott Ambler and renowned consultant Pramodkumar Sadalage introduce powerful refactoring techniques specifically designed for database systems.  Ambler and Sadalage demonstrate how small changes to table structures, data, stored procedures, and triggers can significantly enhance virtually any database design -- without changing semantics. You''ll learn how to evolve database schemas in step with source code -- and become far more effective in projects relying on iterative, agile methodologies.  This comprehensive guide and reference covers every fundamental concept underlying database refactoring, and helps you overcome the practical obstacles to refactoring real-world databases. Start-to-finish examples walk you through refactoring both simple standalone database applications and sophisticated multi-application scenarios.  You''ll master every task involved in refactoring database schemas, and discover best practices for deploying refactorings in even the most complex production environments. The second half of this book systematically covers five major categories of database refactorings. You''ll learn how to use refactoring to enhance database structure, data quality, and referential integrity; and how to refactor both architectures and methods. The book provides an extensive set of examples, built with Oracle and Java, and easily adaptable for other languages, such as C#, C++, or VB.NET. Using this book''s techniques and examples, you can reduce waste, rework, risk, and cost -- and build database systems capable of evolving smoothly, far into the future.

Data warehouses store millions of records, allowing managers  to ask the big-picture questions about their businesses. The authors  of Data Warehouse Design Solutions share their expertise in  designing successful data warehouses and concentrate on understanding  business processes within a variety of industries.
 First, the  authors outline the promise--and potential hurdles--of data  warehousing. They thoroughly explain the idea of dimensional data,  which is used to represent the quantities or attributes that can be  queried in a data warehouse. The authors argue that data warehouses  need to adapt to changing business conditions and often must be more  flexible than planned. They advise building the Enterprise Data  Warehouse (EDW) as a series of interlocking data marts (which contain  different dimensions). Developers can build part of a solution and add  new data marts later. The result is a more adaptable approach to  warehousing data.
 The heart of Data Warehouse Design  Solutions is the descriptions of data warehouses tailored to  specific industries--sales, marketing, fulfillment, production,  inventory, and capacity--using real-world businesses. The authors  offer business models, sample dimensions, database schema, and sample  reports for each business area.
 Later chapters discuss more  advanced areas for data warehousing, including budget tracking,  financial reporting (and managerial accounting), and even how to look  at profitability and intellectual capital. The authors round out their  nuts-and-bolts tour of today''s businesses with a summary of the  various measures that fit each type of organization. Finally, the  authors come back to theory, with some ideas on building effective  systems that are fast and that generate easy-to-read reports. The last  chapter argues convincingly that their incremental approach to  building data warehousing has some distinct advantages. --Richard  DraganProduct Description

In this groundbreaking work, authors and data warehousing visionaries Ralph Kimball and Richard Merz explore a next-generation Web site architecture that exploits the unique nature of the Web''s interactivity to dramatically improve an organization''s understanding of its relationship with users. The Data Webhouse Toolkit isn''t a how-to manual; it is a high-level look at an ambitious new approach to system design.
 The foundation of the concept of Webhouses is the "clickstream"--the plethora of information that can be gleaned if only a system could capture and accurately analyze all of the interaction (or lack thereof) that occurs between Web users and the sites they access. The authors take a careful look at all of the valuable information in the clickstream and point out the complications of compiling this precious information from various gathering sources such as the user''s machine, ISP, and Web site. 
 The book argues strongly for the application of data warehousing and dimensional analysis to the clickstream to radically improve the strategic knowledge of customer motives and actions. While there are no real-life case studies yet to illustrate the concept, this book is bound to whet the appetites of creative entrepreneurs and system architects. --Stephen W. Plain
Topics covered: "Clickstream" concept, opportunities and barriers to information, Web site user tracking, clickstream-driven decisions, clickstream data marts, user interface design, data mining, international concerns, scalability, and project management.

</h3>In this groundbreaking work, authors and data warehousing visionaries Ralph Kimball and Richard Merz explore a next-generation Web site architecture that exploits the unique nature of the Web''s interactivity to dramatically improve an organization''s understanding of its relationship with users. <I>The Data Webhouse Toolkit</I> isn''t a how-to manual; it is a high-level look at an ambitious new approach to system design.<p> The foundation of the concept of Webhouses is the "clickstream"--the plethora of information that can be gleaned if only a system could capture and accurately analyze all of the interaction (or lack thereof) that occurs between Web users and the sites they access. The authors take a careful look at all of the valuable information in the clickstream and point out the complications of compiling this precious information from various gathering sources such as the user''s machine, ISP, and Web site. <p> The book argues strongly for the application of data warehousing and dimensional analysis to the clickstream to radically improve the strategic knowledge of customer motives and actions. While there are no real-life case studies yet to illustrate the concept, this book is bound to whet the appetites of creative entrepreneurs and system architects. <I>--Stephen W. Plain</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: "Clickstream" concept, opportunities and barriers to information, Web site user tracking, clickstream-driven decisions, clickstream data marts, user interface design, data mining, international concerns, scalability, and project management.

Active Directory is probably the single most attractive feature of the   Windows 2000 family of operating systems, so it''s not surprising it''s being   implemented by lots of Windows 2000 adopters. Building Enterprise Active   Directory Services: Notes from the Field takes a practical, consultant''s-eye   view of designing and implementing a reliable Active Directory system to fit   business needs. In absolute terms, it tells you what you need to know, and how   to work with that knowledge to create a system to please customers. Traffic   metrics, cost issues, migration from Windows NT 4, and integration with other   systems (notably Microsoft Exchange Server and Novell NetWare NDS) are all   covered in this book. This is the best Active Directory book to date.
    Perhaps most valuable for most readers is a true-life case study involving   Compaq Corporation, which (as an advance user of Windows 2000) implemented a   company-wide Active Directory system spanning what used to be three large   Windows NT 4 environments. The case study details Compaq''s needs, and then   explains how the company chose its Active Directory topology, established   network links among geographically separate sites, and organized its domains.   It''s a fascinating read, and essential material for anyone working on a project   of similar scope. --David Wall
Topics covered: Windows 2000 and its Active Directory feature, geared   toward consultants, system administrators, and other professionals charged with   making big Active Directory systems work. To this end, the book covers topology   design, traffic planning, tree-and-forest relationships, migration, integration,   and security.

Written for the experienced Java developer, Swing provides an in-depth guide to getting the most out of Sun''s Swing/JFC user interface classes. Mixing real-world code examples and expert advice on advanced features, this book shows how to make use of this powerful library effectively within your own projects.
 The best thing about this text has to be its sample programs, many of which incorporate other Java APIs to do "real" work. For example, a demo of the scroll pane Swing component uses other JFC classes to display JPG images. For working with lists, the authors show how to process .ZIP files in Java. For demonstrating table programming, there''s coverage of JDBC to connect to databases. Other standout code samples include a working FTP client and a fully functional .RTF word processor. (Many of these examples are enhanced in separate steps, showing off new Swing classes and features along the way.) The authors do a particularly good job of annotating code with clear explanations referenced with numbered bullets that point out important lines of code.
 The other noteworthy feature here is the material on extending basic Swing functionality through custom code. (To use Swing effectively, you definitely need to be able to customize its classes. The authors show you how.) There are examples for enhancing Swing with custom layout managers and numerous samples that extend trees and tables, and even a section on the basics of creating new pluggable look and feel (PLAF) modules for Swing.
 With material here on virtually every component and API, plus advanced coverage on using and extending Swing, this in-depth tutorial will prove to be an indispensable resource. It''s ideal for any Java developer who wants to create powerful Swing interfaces for real-world projects. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Overview of Swing and JFC, lightweight and heavyweight controls, Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, Swing pluggable look and feel (PLAF), sizing components, event handing and multithreading issues, timers, graphics debugging, painting and validation, focus management, SwingUtilities methods, frames, panels and borders, built-in and custom layout managers, labels and buttons, tabbed panels, scrolling and split panes, comboboxes and listboxes, text components, Swing undo support, menus and toolbars, progress bars and sliders, JPEG editing, custom and standard dialog boxes, layered panes, custom and built-in MDI support, trees, tables (basic and advanced features), advanced text component programming, sample .RTF word processor, printing, and Java2D API fundamentals.

There are examples for enhancing Swing with custom layout managers and numerous samples that extend trees and tables, and even a section on the basics of creating new pluggable look and feel (PLAF) modules for Swing.<p> With material here on virtually every component and API, plus advanced coverage on using and extending Swing, this in-depth tutorial will prove to be an indispensable resource. It''s ideal for any Java developer who wants to create powerful Swing interfaces for real-world projects. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Overview of Swing and JFC, lightweight and heavyweight controls, Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, Swing pluggable look and feel (PLAF), sizing components, event handing and multithreading issues, timers, graphics debugging, painting and validation, focus management, SwingUtilities methods, frames, panels and borders, built-in and custom layout managers, labels and buttons, tabbed panels, scrolling and split panes, comboboxes and listboxes, text components, Swing undo support, menus and toolbars, progress bars and sliders, JPEG editing, custom and standard dialog boxes, layered panes, custom and built-in MDI support, trees, tables (basic and advanced features), advanced text component programming, sample .RTF word processor, printing, and Java2D API fundamentals.

Recipient of the 1997 Jolt Award.
The developer of the acclaimed Eiffel programming  language comes through with one of the clearest and most informative  books about computers ever committed to paper. Object-Oriented  Software Construction is the gospel of object-oriented technology and  it deserves to be spread everywhere. Meyer opens with coverage of the  need for an object-oriented approach to software development, citing  improved quality and development speed as key advantages of the  approach. He then explains all the key criteria that define an object-  oriented approach to a problem. Meyer pays attention to techniques,  such as classes, objects, memory management, and more, returning to  each technique and polishing his readers'' knowledge of it as he  explains how to employ it "well." In a section on advanced topics,  Meyer explores interesting and relevant topics, such as persistent  objects stored in a database. He also offers a sort of "Do and Don''t"  section in which he enumerates common mistakes and ways to avoid  them. Management information isn''t the main point of Object-Oriented  Software Construction, but you''ll find some in its pages. Meyer  concludes his tour de force with comparisons of all the key  object-oriented languages, including Java. He also covers the  potential of simulating object technology in non-object-oriented  languages, such as Pascal and Fortran. The companion CD-ROM includes  the full text of this book in hypertext form, as well as some tools  for designing object-oriented systems. If you program computers, you  need to read this book.

A hands-on tutorial on building and using multidimensional data warehouses    The SQL query language is used to access data in most simple databases. But for multidimensional (or OLAP) data warehouses, Microsoft developed MDX. The MDX query language has become essential know-how for developers and users alike, whether for data warehouses or for budgeting and planning systems. This tutorial/reference guide shows developers and users how to use MDX to access and analyze data for decision support. Both the standard language and Microsoft''s own extensive additions to MDX are explained. The authors provide practical examples of MDX in use, and explain both standard usage and more advanced techniques, such as optimization, cube design, and Pareto analysis.

Showstopper! is a vivid account of the creation of  Microsoft Windows NT, perhaps the most complex software project ever  undertaken. It is also a portrait of David Cutler, NT''s brilliant and,  at times, brutally aggressive chief architect.
 Cutler surely ranks  as one of the most impressive software engineers the field has ever  produced. After leading the team that created the VMS operating system  for Digital''s VAX computer line--an accomplishment that most would  regard as a lifetime achievement--he went on to conceive and lead the  grueling multi-year project that ultimately produced Windows NT. Both  admired and feared by his team, Cutler would let nothing stand in the  way of realizing his design and often clashed with his programmers,  senior Microsoft management, and even Gates himself. Yet no matter how  involved he became in managing his 100-programmer team, he continued  to immerse himself in every technical detail of the project and write  critical portions of the code himself.
Showstopper! is also  a fascinating look at programmer and managerial culture behind the  Microsoft facade. The portraits of the men and women who created NT  not only reveal the brilliance of their work but the crushing stress  and the dislocating effects that new wealth had on their lives. For  some team members, the NT project ultimately destroyed their  marriages, friendships, and virtually every human relationship outside  of work. Showstopper! also reveals the uncertainties, false  starts, and blind alleys that dogged the project as Microsoft  repositioned NT from an improved OS/2 to something that would  ultimately challenge both OS/2 and Unix for the title of the world''s  most powerful operating system.

Product Description

 The phenomenal success of Bill Gates and his Microsoft Corporation hinges, above all, on an ability to look to the future. Not content with holding a bulging share of the market for software applications, nor with dominating the crucial operating systems business by virtue of its DOS and Windows programs, Microsoft is always looking to the future. And the future for Microsoft now goes by the name of Windows NT. A software innovation of the first order, NT could redefine the standards for computing throughout the world, into the next century. NT endows inexpensive personal computers with the capabilities of giant mainframes -- yet without sacrificing the inherent flexibility and appeal of PCs. 
Showstopper! is the inside story of this stunning breakthrough in computer technology. Stripping away myth after myth, this unprecedented tale lays bare the messy, wrenching reality of winning innovations. To date, America has dominated the global software industry through creating cutting-edge code and by depending on both the ingenuity of a few visionaries and the coordination of huge, costly teams of programmers and testers. Gates -- a managerial genius as well as a technical visionary -- promotes an atmosphere of controlled chaos at Microsoft, and the story of Windows NT perfectly reflects this ethos. The brain-child of David Cutler, a legendary programmer recruited by Gates in 1988, NT took five years and $150 million to complete. For much of that time, the massive program demanded the obsessive attention of more than 200 testers, writers and technicians. 
 Focusing on Cutler''s mercurial ability to inspire and lash his team, Showstopper! brilliantly portrays the human drama of this mammoth undertaking exposing the pressures, disappointments and ultimate triumph that emerge from a cauldron of constant deadlines, competition with peers and a perpetual war against the inevitable and ubiquitous bugs in the program -- among them the potentially lethal "showstopper." 
 Gripping vivid and accessible, Showstopper! reveals the outsize personalities that stand behind great advances: the mavericks, the organizers, the fixers, the motivators. Even as they wrestle with forces that threaten to tear them apart, Cutler and his team feverishly hunt for computing''s Holy Grail.

Windows  Presentation Foundation (WPF) replaces Microsoft’s diverse presentation  technologies with a unified, state-of-the-art platform for building  rich applications. WPF combines the best of Windows and the Web; fully  integrates user interfaces, documents, and media; and leverages the  full power of XML-based declarative programming. 
In Essential Windows Presentation Foundation,  former WPF architect Chris Anderson systematically introduces this  breakthrough platform, focusing on the concepts and techniques working  developers need in order to build robust applications for real users.  Drawing on his unique experience as an architect on the team, Anderson  thoroughly illuminates the crucial new concepts underlying WPF and  reveals how its APIs work together to offer developers unprecedented  value.
Through working sample code, you’ll  discover how WPF draws on the Web’s simple models for markup and  deployment, common frame for applications, and rich server  connectivity, and on Windows’ rich client model, simple programming  model, strong control over look-and-feel, and rich networking. Topics  explored in depth includeWPF components and architecture Key WPF design decisions–and why they matter XAML markup language Controls Layouts Visuals and media, including 2D, 3D, video, and animation Data integration Actions Styles WPF Base Services

Microsoft .NET is an innovative software framework that promises to change software development as we know it. This book answers the questions "What is Microsoft .NET and how do I profit from it?" The author breaks these questions down into "What problems does Microsoft .NET solve?"; "What architectural approaches does it take to solve them?"; and "How do I get started using it?" Each chapter is written in a logical, pyramidal format, with simpler, high-level concepts introduced first, followed by a more detailed technical discussion, so readers can easily choose how deep they wish to go into each chapter.

Filled with real-world advice for managing software projects,  Murray Cantor''s Object-Oriented Project Management with UML  shows you how to tackle any project using UML and the latest thinking  on project management. There''s little doubt that this even-handed,  commonsensical guide can benefit anyone who manages or designs  object-oriented software for a living.
 The best thing about this  book has to be its honest, real-world mix of software engineering  theory and real-world practice for managing object-oriented software  development. The author refuses to be doctrinaire and continually  offers valuable nuggets of practical advice. Regarding the pitfalls of  one software development process, he writes, "I am sure someone has  succeeded, but I have never seen it done." Later, he advises managers  to "never show panic."
 The book doesn''t skimp on specifics with a  sample case study on a jet fighter trainer simulation system that has  a budget of over $22 million. The book also provides real numbers for  project estimation, bug tracking, and resource allocation. You''ll even  find numbers for measuring productivity, including KLOCs. Numerous  sample documents (including sample meeting agendas) round out the tour  here. The book offers plenty of good advice for working with upper  management, customers, and development teams throughout the software  development process.
 While there''s certainly no substitute for  actual project management experience, Object-Oriented Project  Management with UML may be the next best thing. The author''s tour  of how to manage object-oriented software development offers dozens of  savvy tips and a very thorough guide to using some of the best  available techniques for software management. This book is perfect for  practically minded IS managers or project leaders who want to see how  their software development process can be improved using UML with  rigorous management techniques. --Richard Dragan
Topics  covered: object-oriented project management overview; obstacles;  UML basics; use cases; class diagrams; lifecycle models: waterfall,  spiral, RAD; time box model and controlled iteration; Software  Development Plans (SDPs); budgeting; project estimation; management  tips for inception, elaboration, construction, and transition phases;  software metrics: KLOCs and COCOMO; measuring productivity; and sample  meeting agendas.

Product Description
Almost all software projects are risky. The goal of every project manager is to somehow deal with the cost and schedule uncertainty while meeting your customer''s needs. In Object-Oriented Project Management with UML, Murray Cantor describes an elegant, UML-based approach to managing object-oriented projects guaranteed to deliver high-quality software on time and within budget.  * Sample project schedules, budgets, database templates for managing use cases, and a work-breakdown structure    * A spreadsheet workbook for managing incremental development    * A development tracking diagram    Prior to joining TASC, Dr. Cantor was a development manager at IBM, where he oversaw the development of high-end graphics and multimedia systems.

Jamie Oliver''s Happy Days with the Naked Chef is in the same mold as his bestselling cookbooks, The Naked Chef and The Naked Chef Takes Off: recipes for simple, comforting food. This time, however, he has some interesting additions from his travels to Australia, New Zealand, America, and Japan. There are three new ideas in Happy Days with the Naked Chef. Oliver has included a chapter on "Comfort Food"--the kind of cooking Nigel Slater and Nigella Lawson specialize in. There are recipes for British favorites like Toad in the Hole, Fish Finger Buttie, and Sticky Sausage Bap with Melted Cheese and Brown Sauce. In his "Quick Fixes" chapter, Oliver has selected dishes where saving time and minimal washing up are the key ingredients. These include a Steak Sarnie and Chicken Breast Baked in a Bag with Mushrooms, Butter, White Wine, and Thyme. He has also included a "Kids Club" chapter, which offers inspiration for parents trying to get their children excited about food. The new additions don''t dominate the book as the remaining two-thirds contain Oliver''s standard  Italian-style fare: simple salads, fish, meat, vegetables, breads, and desserts. Don''t miss the excellent recipe for Medallions of Beef with Morels and Marsala and Crème Fraîche Sauce. Oliver has also been traveling and you''ll find recipes with bok choy, soy sauce, and ginger popping up here and there--delicious!  --Elizabeth Murgatroyd, Amazon.co.uk', N'<h3 class="review">From Amazon.com

This book begins with you working along as Scott Guthrie builds a complete ASP.NET MVC reference application. He begins NerdDinner by using the File->New Project menu command within Visual Studio to create a new ASP.NET MVC Application. You''ll then incrementally add functionality and features. Along the way you’ll cover how to create a database, build a model layer with business rule validations, implement listing/details data browsing, provide CRUD (Create, Update, Delete) data form entry support, implement efficient data paging, reuse UI using master pages and partials, secure the application using authentication and authorization, use AJAX to deliver dynamic updates and interactive map support, and implement automated unit testing.  
 From there, the bulk of the rest of the book begins with the basic concepts around the model view controller pattern, including the little history and the state of the MVC on the web today. We''ll then go into the ways that MVC is different from ASP.NET Web Forms. We''ll explore the structure of a standard MVC application and see what you get out of the box. Next we dig deep into routing and see the role URLs play in your application. We''ll deep dive into controllers and views and see what role the Ajax plays in your applications. The last third of the book focuses entirely on advanced techniques and extending the framework.  
 In some places, we assume that you''re somewhat familiar with ASP.NET WebForms, at least peripherally. There are a lot of ASP.NET WebForms developers out there who are interested in ASP.NET MVC so there are a number of places in this book where we contrast the two technologies. Even if you''re not already an ASP.NET developer, you might still find these sections interesting for context, as well as for your own edification as ASP.NET MVC may not be the web technology that you''re looking for.  
 It’s worth noting, that ASP.NET MVC is not a replacement for ASP.NET Web Forms (aka just "ASP.NET"). Many web developers have been giving a lot of attention to other web frameworks out there (Ruby on Rails, Django) which have embraced the MVC (Model-View-Controller) application pattern, and if you’re one of those developers, or even if you’re just curious, this book is for you.  
 MVC allows for (buzzword alert!) a "greater separation of concerns" between components in your application. The book goes into the ramifications of this, but if it had to be said it in a quick sentence: ASP.NET MVC is ASP.NET Unplugged. ASP.NET MVC is a tinkerer’s framework that gives you very fine-grained control over your HTML and Javascript, as well as complete control over the programmatic flow of your application.

Kent Beck''s eXtreme Programming eXplained provides an intriguing high-level overview of the author''s Extreme Programming (XP) software development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders, or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development teams.
 The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles, and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the author notes, these principles are not new, but when they''re combined their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which form the basis of XP.
 Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows where XP works and where it doesn''t and offers suggestions for migrating teams and organizations over to the XP process. 
 In the afterword, the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially better way to build software. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles, XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software lifecycle, and adopting XP.

Your class library works, but could it be better?  Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code shows how refactoring can make object-oriented code simpler and easier to maintain. Today refactoring requires considerable design know-how, but once tools become available, all programmers should be able to improve their code using refactoring techniques.
 Besides an introduction to refactoring, this handbook provides a catalog of dozens of tips for improving code. The best thing about Refactoring is its remarkably clear presentation, along with excellent nuts-and-bolts advice, from object expert Martin Fowler. The author is also an authority on software patterns and UML, and this experience helps make this a better book, one that should be immediately accessible to any intermediate or advanced object-oriented developer. (Just like patterns, each refactoring tip is presented with a simple name, a "motivation," and examples using Java and UML.) 
 Early chapters stress the importance of testing in successful refactoring. (When you improve code, you have to test to verify that it still works.) After the discussion on how to detect the "smell" of bad code, readers get to the heart of the book, its catalog of over 70 "refactorings"--tips for better and simpler class design. Each tip is illustrated with "before" and "after" code, along with an explanation. Later chapters provide a quick look at refactoring research.
 Like software patterns, refactoring may be an idea whose time has come. This groundbreaking title will surely help bring refactoring to the programming mainstream. With its clear advice on a hot new topic, Refactoring is sure to be essential reading for anyone who writes or maintains object-oriented software. --Richard Dragan
Topics Covered: Refactoring, improving software code, redesign, design tips, patterns, unit testing, refactoring research, and tools.

Programmers are craftspeople trained to use a certain set of tools (editors, object managers, version trackers) to generate a certain kind of product (programs) that will operate in some environment (operating systems on hardware assemblies). Like any other craft, computer programming has spawned a body of wisdom, most of which isn''t taught at universities or in certification classes. Most programmers arrive at the so-called tricks of the trade over time, through independent experimentation. In The Pragmatic Programmer, Andrew Hunt and David Thomas codify many of the truths they''ve discovered during their respective careers as designers of software and writers of code.
 Some of the authors'' nuggets of pragmatism are concrete, and the path to their implementation is clear. They advise readers to learn one text editor, for example, and use it for everything. They also recommend the use of version-tracking software for even the smallest projects, and promote the merits of learning regular expression syntax and a text-manipulation language. Other (perhaps more valuable) advice is more light-hearted. In the debugging section, it is noted that, "if you see hoof prints think horses, not zebras." That is, suspect everything, but start looking for problems in the most obvious places. There are recommendations for making estimates of time and expense, and for integrating testing into the development process. You''ll want a copy of The Pragmatic Programmer for two reasons: it displays your own accumulated wisdom more cleanly than you ever bothered to state it, and it introduces you to methods of work that you may not yet have considered. Working programmers will enjoy this book. --David Wall
Topics covered: A useful approach to software design and construction that allows for efficient, profitable development of high-quality products. Elements of the approach include specification development, customer relations, team management, design practices, development tools, and testing procedures. This approach is presented with the help of anecdotes and technical problems.

This book provides a worthwhile tour of Microsoft technologies  based on DCOM and Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) with plenty of  advice for today''s enterprise developer.
 The book begins with  Microsoft''s Distributed Internet Architecture (DNA) and DNA''s notion  of a three-tier model for separating business objects for better  scalability. Of course, COM is an important part of DNA, and the  author''s introduction to COM is as good as any. Coverage of database  acronyms such as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity), ADO (ActiveX Data  Objects), and OLE-DB (Object Linking and Embedding Database) round out  the basics. Then the author proceeds to explain the capabilities of  MTS, from using it as an object request broker (ORB) for locating  remote services, to the fundamentals of transaction processing.
 At  this point, theory becomes practice, and the author walks the reader  through a complete sample MTS-based application, an automated  accounting package for the "Classifieds" section of a small  newspaper. The author shows how to use Microsoft Visual Database Tools  and provides a taste of Microsoft''s software methodology called  Microsoft Solutions Framework (MSF). After you learn how to model  objects for the database and business object layers, the book helps  you build them using Visual Basic and Visual C++. Finally, you learn  the presentation layer, which is built using Active Server Pages  (ASPs) for running inside a browser.
 Final chapters offer material  on additional Microsoft tools, such as the COM-to-mainframe tool  (called COMTI) and Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ). There''s also  a preview of COM+--still under construction and due out with Windows  2000. In all, Designing Component-Based Applications  successfully covers the state of the art in component development for  the enterprise using the complete range of available Microsoft tools  and technologies. --Richard DraganProduct Description
DESIGNING COMPONENT-BASED DEVELOPMENT is an invaluable primer on writing a distributed application using Microsoft(r) Windows(r) Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA).  It begins by providing essential overviews of the technologies that make Windows DNA viable: COM, the standard for component creations; OLE DB and ADO, the ingredients that deliver universal data access; Active Server Pages (ASP), for integration and presentation; Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), the server side of the equation and the key to scalability; and MSMQ, the messaging services that extend MTS for the enterprise.    
From there, the book addresses application planning and implementation in a series of chapters, taking as a sample the complete enterprise application developed by the COM and Visual tools teams: Island Hopper.  This sample illustrates a host of design and coding practices that make for successful development and deployment of three-tier applications.  Nowhere is it explained in detail except here in this book.  Remaining chapters cover testing and debugging the three-tier application.  A concluding chapter looks ahead to COM+ and the impact it will have on component-based projects such as Island Hopper.  Altogether the book provides a rare mix of conceptual information, first-hand design advice, and practical coding samples to guide enterprise developers and planners into new and demanding territory.

Getting very different computer systems from multiple vendors--whether on desktops, servers, or mainframes--to share data and processing power is one goal of Enterprise Application Integration (EAI). David Linthicum''s Enterprise Application Integration tours the technologies needed to master EAI. For any IS manager or system architect who needs to see what EAI offers, this title will definitely fit the bill.
 The text offers a wide-ranging perspective on the challenges facing EAI, as well as the strategies and technologies that can help it succeed. The author makes a compelling case for getting various "stovepipe" systems (like inventory and financial applications) to share information and processing power. (While data warehousing combines databases, EAI goes further and integrates everything--data, methods, and objects.) This text details strategies for effective EAI using a variety of middleware products (like message servers, CORBA, and COM).
 A standout here is the attention to mainframe topics like "packaged" applications (especially SAP R/3) that don''t lend themselves to integration easily, as well as "data scraping" (which lets legacy terminal applications communicate with newer systems). There is coverage here of tools and solutions from all major vendors, including IBM, SAP, Sun, and Microsoft. Later in the book, Linthicum argues for the strengths of Java for EAI, whether for remote processing or enterprise components like EJBs. He also looks at XML for data exchange in business-to-business e-commerce. 
 Few authors demonstrate such a wide knowledge of tools and technologies from so many vendors. This is precisely the perspective that EAI practitioners will undoubtedly need. Enterprise Application Integration delivers a thorough roadmap to the future of this emerging area of computing. It''s a great place to start for any IS manager or software engineer seeking to understand the advantages of EAI for streamlining systems in an ever more connected world. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) overview, types of legacy systems, EAI and e-business, data-level EAI, application interface-level EAI, method warehousing and method-level EAI, user interface-level EAI, data scraping, guide to the EAI process, middleware models, transactional middleware, XA and X/Open basics, RPCs, messaging (Microsoft MSMQ and IBM MQSeries), distributed objects, CORBA and COM, database APIs for middleware (ODBC and JDBC), Java middleware, integrating SAP R/3 and PeopleSoft packaged applications, supply chain integration and business-to-business e-commerce, XML basics, message brokers, process automation, and the future of EAI.

Product Description
Organizations that are able to integrate their applications and data sources have a distinct competitive advantage: strategic utilization of company data and technology for greater efficiency and profit. But IT managers attempting integration face daunting challenges--disparate legacy systems; a hodgepodge of hardware, operating systems, and networking technology; proprietary packaged applications; and more.    
Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) offers a solution to this increasingly urgent business need. It encompasses technologies that enable business processes and data to speak to one another across applications, integrating many individual systems into a seamless whole.    
Enterprise Application Integration provides a comprehensive examination of EAI. You will find an overview of EAI goals and approaches, a review of the technologies that support it, and a roadmap to implementing an EAI solution. You will also find an in-depth explanation of the four major types of EAI: data-level, application interface-level, method-level, and user interface-level. The book describes in detail the middleware models and technologies that support these different approaches, including:     
* Application servers, including the use of Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) and ActiveX   * Message-oriented middleware (MOM) and remote procedure calls (RPCs)   * Distributed objects, looking at CORBA and COM   * Database-oriented middleware and standards, including ODBC, JDBC, and OLE DB   * Java middleware standards   * Message brokers   * New process automation and workflow technology     
This practical guide to implementing an EAI solution leads you through all the major steps, including identifying sources of data, building the enterprise metadata model, process integration, identifying application interfaces, mapping information movement, selecting and applying the technologies, testing, and maintenance. Other key topics include integrating packaged applications such as SAP R/3 and PeopleSoft, integrating the supply chain using EAI, the role of XML, and process automation. Comprehensive, practical, and clearly written, this essential resource will help anyone involved in this important business area understand the nature of EAI, its tools and techniques, and how to apply it for a significant business advantage.

Written for the project manager or IT professional, AntiPatterns in   Project Management describes 18 "AntiPatterns" that can go wrong in the   realm of software project management, plus management techniques and tips to   overcome them. Filled with real-world insight and case studies that describe   actual projects gone awry, this title gives a solid measure of management   expertise that can help you succeed with your next project.
    Early sections of the text set the tone with management techniques that stress   standards and rigorous software processes. The authors discuss the importance of   managing people, technology, and processes for successful project management.   While most books on patterns keep descriptions short and almost schematic, an   entire chapter--filled with background material on the causes, solutions (or   "refactoring") to move beyond it, and examples borrowed from the field--is   devoted to each AntiPattern. (The names of companies have been changed, which   makes for less dramatic reading, although this was no doubt a legal   necessity.)
    Anyone who has worked in software development will recognize many of the   AntiPatterns here. First, bad management and bad management practices get their   due--managers who don''t or can''t manage, projects that are late and require that   staff be added at the last minute, and obstreperous employees (or "corncobs")   who can''t or won''t work in teams.
    Descriptions of technology AntiPatterns include troubles with distributed   technologies, lack of architecture, demos that grow into unusable "finished"   software, and software that hasn''t undergone any planning at all. When it comes   to process management, things can go wrong, too, as in the case of misapplied   software life cycles. (In this section, the book lists no fewer than nine   different software life cycles from which you can choose.) Other process   AntiPatterns include customers who drive software design all the way through to   disaster, the "domino effect" of changes to staff that can destroy team   effectiveness, and management that demands adherence to an already late shipping   date. Final sections show how these AntiPatterns often occur in conjunction. The   book concludes with some "critical aspects" for successful project   management.
    Although a bit theoretical at times, this title has plenty of practical advice   on improving your everyday project-management success. As the authors note, the   great majority of software projects today are considered failures. By reading   this savvy and well-organized volume, and analyzing what can go wrong, you can   improve the odds in your favor in future development efforts. --Richard   Dragan

The Active Template Library (ATL) is the part of the Microsoft  Foundation Classes (MFC) used to build reusable and very efficient  components in C++. Achieving this efficiency can be difficult, as it  requires you to delve into the details of Microsoft''s Component Object  Model (COM) and ATL itself. With Beginning ATL COM  Programming, however, it should be possible for any C++/MFC  programmer to become productive with this exciting component  technology.
 The book begins with the basics of COM programming,  featuring good details on the actual Win32 APIs used throughout COM  programming. (This section also discusses the basics of the component  definition, including Interface Definition Language [IDL] and related  conventions.) While higher-level classes in MFC make it easier to  build COM components, you''ll have to do most of the work yourself if  you''re building lightweight ATL controls. The authors cover such ATL  topics as event handling (with connection points), automation and  error handling, and properties and persistence for ATL-based  components. They use plenty of short, effective code examples  throughout this tutorial to illustrate key concepts.
 The book  closes with an example of Internet Explorer ATL controls (which are  leaner) and "full" controls (which can be reused in such applications  as Visual Basic). The world of ATL development is rough terrain, but  the team of authors here succeeds in explaining a difficult subject  clearly. --Rich DraganProduct Description
The book covers programming the latest version of the Active   Template Library ( ATL ) which is currently in version 2.1. The book   uses Visual C++ 5 as the programming environment. Earlier versions of   VC++, back to 4.0 may be used in conjunction with the ATL additions   that can be downloaded from Microsoft.  VC++ is increasingly used to   develop ActiveX components for use elsewhere, for example in VB or on   the Web. These components have to small and light, and be able to   interoperate with whatever their host application is. COM is the   Microsoft technology that allows the components to interoperate, while   ATL is a tool that simplifies the creation of these components. Where   VC++ programmers use MFC to create stand alone applications, ATL is a   lighter, faster substitute for creating just components.

With its support for fast and efficient COM components, the Active Template Library (ATL) 3 is probably the preferred method of writing code with today''s Visual C++. There is perhaps no better choice for getting started with ATL than Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming, a guide that covers all the basics for anyone with some C++ experience who is new to this powerful library.
 This title strikes a valuable balance between exploring the ATL wizards in Visual C++ 6 and explaining (and tweaking) this tool-generated code. Early sections look at the basics of COM, from basic interfaces and conventions. At first, code is written manually without ATL. The book then turns to the Visual C++ wizards for writing COM components. A notable section here covers the many "maps" that are used by ATL to show off where to customize events and other custom features. The authors also do a good job with the basics of dual interfaces (for OLE Automation) and remote COM (DCOM).
 ATL 3 can be used to manage windows and dialog controls, and the book points the way to working with basic and advanced dialog components (including common controls). This text culminates in a tutorial on ATL controls (which can be used on the Web inside Internet Explorer). The authors provide a step-by-step guide to creating a fully functional ATL component (which displays URLs inside a TreeView). 
 The new ATL 3 offers a lot to developers, and Beginning ATL 3 COM Programming shows you how to take advantage of its built-in strengths. ATL is still tough terrain to master, but this title matches the right level of technical detail with tutorial code that really does put this powerful library into the hands of every C++ developer. Read it to start mastering the premier framework for Visual C++. --Richard Dragan

Until the early ''90s, project management was definitely  located somewhere near the unsexy end of the business spectrum. But  now, with the rise of downsizing and outsourcing, it has become one of  the hot disciplines. Professional membership of the U.S.-based Project  Management Institute has quadrupled in the last decade, and Microsoft  claimed recently to have over 2 million users worldwide of its  project-management software. The reasons for this growth are  simple. Project management is about managing "projects," that is,  unique pieces of work (as opposed to ongoing operations). Downsizing,  outsourcing, and the accelerating pace of change have meant that,  increasingly, work is carried out on an ad-hoc, one-off project  basis. The Fast Forward MBA in Project Management is designed  as an advanced textbook for businesspeople with a grasp of the basics  and insufficient time (or inclination) to go back to school to learn  more. Written by Eric Verzuh, president of the Versatile Company, a  leading project-management consultancy, this is not a heavy academic  text.
    Like the rest of the Fast Forward series, this book is designed  to let the reader extract maximum information in minimum time. There  is a strong use of graphics with tables, charts cross-heads, and  bullet points. Important passages are flagged in bold and/or  emblazoned with the words key concept. When you read it, you  realize that there is nothing magical about project management, just  the application of careful common sense. The book covers all the basic  stuff like planning, time-tabling, quantity and price estimation,  resource allocation, and scheduling. But it also acknowledges that  there is inevitably a political dimension to every project, no matter  how small. So it has important sections on how to ensure that all the  stakeholders in the project are kept "on board" and the importance of  communication.
    As Verzuh states in his introduction, "Every project participant from  part-time team member to executive sponsor, becomes more effective  once he or she understands the basics of project management." Really,  this is a book about management that every manager should read,  whether he or she has a project or not. --Alex BenadyProduct Description

Downsizing,  outsourcing, and the accelerating pace of change have meant that,  increasingly, work is carried out on an ad-hoc, one-off project  basis. <I>The Fast Forward MBA in Project Management</I> is designed  as an advanced textbook for businesspeople with a grasp of the basics  and insufficient time (or inclination) to go back to school to learn  more. Written by Eric Verzuh, president of the Versatile Company, a  leading project-management consultancy, this is not a heavy academic  text.<p>    Like the rest of the Fast Forward series, this book is designed  to let the reader extract maximum information in minimum time. There  is a strong use of graphics with tables, charts cross-heads, and  bullet points. Important passages are flagged in bold and/or  emblazoned with the words <i>key concept</i>. When you read it, you  realize that there is nothing magical about project management, just  the application of careful common sense. The book covers all the basic  stuff like planning, time-tabling, quantity and price estimation,  resource allocation, and scheduling. But it also acknowledges that  there is inevitably a political dimension to every project, no matter  how small. So it has important sections on how to ensure that all the  stakeholders in the project are kept "on board" and the importance of  communication.<p>    As Verzuh states in his introduction, "Every project participant from  part-time team member to executive sponsor, becomes more effective  once he or she understands the basics of project management." Really,  this is a book about management that every manager should read,  whether he or she has a project or not. <I>--Alex Benady</I>

With the emergence of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) over  the last few years, developers new to the advantages of thorough  software-engineering practices now have a better notational system for  designing more effective software. To use UML effectively, you will  want to create use cases, which help describe the requirements  of a system. In their concise and very readable book, the authors of  Applying Use Cases show how use cases can benefit all aspects  of the software-design process and let you create better software in  less time.
 This guide provides a case study for a mail-order  business (with some e-commerce as well) as its central example. Use  cases define how actors (i.e., users) are defined for all the  various components of a mail-order business, including inventory,  accounting, and order fulfillment. The authors suggest that while use  cases are particularly useful at the beginning of a project cycle--for  assessing risks and setting project timetables, for instance--they are  also useful for testing and deployment of systems (specifically, for  creating documentation and help manuals). The sample use cases--and  supporting design documents--are what''s best in this  text. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Many projects struggle to define the specific functions of software, and end users often find that the final product does not perform as expected. Use cases allow analysts to identify the required features of a software system based on how each end user will use the system. This efficient and straightforward analysis process gives end users direct input into the design of the system that will serve them. Applying Use Cases provides a practical and clear introduction to developing use cases, demonstrating their use via a continuing case study. Using the Unified Software Development Process as a framework and the Unified Modeling Language (UML) as a notation, the authors step the reader through applying use cases in the different phases of the process, focusing on where and how use cases are best applied.Other highlights include:  *A collection of realistic examples showing how to apply use cases, drawn from the authors'' extensive experience in this area *A case study that offers insight into the common mistakes and pitfalls that can plague an object-oriented project *An illustration of the latest version of the UML notation for diagramming use cases *A practical "how-to" discussion on applying use cases to identify system requirements 0201309815B04062001

OFFICE XP INSIDE OUT

Amazon.com Review
As office productivity suites grow more capable and network-wise, the demand placed upon their users--who typically are everyday office workers with no particular interest in software technology--grows dramatically. That''s why a carefully compiled manual, like Microsoft Office XP Inside Out, is invaluable in an organization that expects its employees to use the new features of Microsoft Office XP. This book won''t hold your interest if you attempt to read it straight through, and indeed it may strain your back when you lift it off the shelf. On the other hand, if you want a concise but comprehensive tutorial on the use of Excel''s PMT function or FrontPage''s new ability to output XML code--or any of hundreds of other details--this book has your number. Just check the jumbo-size index. 
    The book could have paid more attention to automating Office XP with Visual Basic. Even though more space is devoted to the programming language than most of the competition and the book does a good job of explaining the core language and key objects, a lot of its capabilities go unmentioned. 
    Otherwise, the authors do a wonderful job of explaining procedures and concepts whose power lies in their details. In explaining features, they''ll typically present a procedure that covers the generic case, then discuss variations on that theme in longer paragraphs and special sidebars. As is the trend in books like this, screen shots are augmented with labels and instructions--this aids clarity and speeds up the answer-finding process. --David Wall
Topics covered: Everything that the programs in the Microsoft Office XP suite--Word, Excel, Access, PowerPoint, Exchange, FrontPage, and Publisher--can do, including customization via Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) to an extent. Creating, formatting, editing, sharing, storing, and the rest of the work that Office assists in is covered.

The team behind Professional Active Server Pages 2.0 has written a definitive guide for the latest version of ASP included with Windows 2000. This lengthy text offers a comprehensive look at the technology and is geared toward seasoned professionals looking to truly master this important development platform. The team of authors touch on almost every topic a working ASP coder might be interested in, including what to do when "it all goes wrong." 
 This title is divided into six sections that focus on key aspects of ASP: the basics, ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), building components for ASP, integration with BackOffice, security/performance/scalability, and reference material. This organization makes the book useful for both lengthy reads and quick daily reference. The index and set of appendices are also quite comprehensive.
 Code snippets of judicious size and summary boxes with key information such as errors and function calls make the reading productive without being distracting. Most of the material is presented in a structured topical tutorial; however, an excellent XML newspaper case study provides a real-world perspective on XML and ASP.
 While a number of working programmers authored this guide, the group''s expertise has been well-integrated to read consistently. The team provides some error-preventing programming procedures such as formatting and indenting code, being "Explicit" about declarations, converting variables to the appropriate data types, using good variable naming conventions, encapsulating script, and more. Whether you''re looking for information on utilizing components, implementing certificates, or working with Active Directory, you''ll find answers in this fine work. --Stephen W. Plain
Topics covered: ASP basics and versions, Active Server Components, ADO, XML data, components, COM/COM+, ASP Script Components, C++ component issues, ADSI and Active Directory, Message Queue Server, Collaboration Data Objects, Exchange Server integration, certificates, performance optimization, site load balancing, and ASP Object Model.

Product Description
This book is about Active Server Pages 3.0, as included with Windows 2000. However, because ASP is now a core part of so many Web-oriented features within Windows, this book covers a far wider area than just how ASP works. ASP is maturing all the time to encompass more integration with other Windows services and software, and so there are many other areas that impinge directly on the use and performance of ASP.   
  In particular this involves the Windows operating system itself, including the new security features of Windows 2000, and the Internet server software that comes with Windows 2000 - Internet Information Server (IIS). On top of this are the other less obvious services, which also have a direct or indirect effect on the way that ASP works. These include COM+, the various Internet service administration tools, and (indirectly) the many other services and installed software packages that either provide additional functionality to ASP, or which have interfaces that are available for use in ASP.   
  So, as well as chapters all about the roots of ASP, the base object structure, and how it''s used, you''ll also see chapters that demonstrate the many different ways that ASP integrates seamlessly with other software and services in Windows. One of the most obvious of these is access to data in a relational database or other type of data store (such as Active Directory), and you''ll see several chapters devoted to these topics.   
  We''ll also explore the intimate relationship between Internet Information Server and COM and the new COM+, and see how ASP has changed the way that it hosts and executes external components to provide better performance and scalability. This also affects the way that components are designed and built, and we''ll be exploring this topic in some depth as well.

Aimed at aspiring C# programmers of all levels, legendary Windows expert Charles Petzold''s Programming Windows with C# provides an extremely in-depth and intelligent tutorial to the APIs underpinning Microsoft''s .NET Framework.
For a generation of programmers, Petzold''s Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide to the Win32 API provided a virtual bible on how to get started with Windows development. This massive, handsomely bound hardcover edition attempts the same breadth of coverage for Microsoft''s new C# language and the new .NET. With several examples clearly inspired by the earlier C title, this book demonstrates the author''s keen eye for showing off and explaining the capabilities of low-level APIs to good effect.
The book first outlines basic "Hello World" examples for both a console and Windows Forms. Next, there''s coverage of basic support classes (like points and rectangles) before turning toward using these structures in extensive sections on graphics programming. Petzold''s traditional strengths as a computer author are in ample evidence here, with many short examples that exercise the capabilities of the new .NET APIs.
Veteran readers will recognize the basic shape of the early Win32 title in the organization of this (completely rewritten) C# version in the flow of topics from graphics, keyboard, mouse and timers, and the like. (One production note here is that the order of later chapters does jump around somewhat, circling back to graphics topics several times instead of presenting related APIs in order.)
The sections on graphics transforms and how to manipulate images are worthy of note. There''s excellent coverage of the possibilities of working with text and fonts output in .NET. Nifty working samples for several types of clocks and shape-drawing demos will let you explore graphical APIs in detail.
Several chapters cover basic Windows Forms control programming with buttons, labels, and edit controls and then splitters, ListView, and TreeView controls. This volume closes out with references to files and streams, and math and string APIs. For any developer who wants to create state-of-the-art, "traditional" client-side software, this book is sure to be required reading for its in-depth look at graphics and other leading-edge .NET features. It proves once again that learning low-level APIs in detail is still a good way to learn Windows programming. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Overview of C# and .NET Windows programming fundamentals; a "Hello World" console application; C# language and object basics; a simple Windows Forms application (creating a main window and handling the paint events); basic .NET structures (including rectangles, points, and colors); text output and scrolling; exploring .NET system information; in-depth tutorial for GDI+ programming: pens, lines, rectangles, and polygons; keyboard processing (plus a custom class for caret processing); graphics transformations (including scaling, linear transforms with matrices); mouse processing (plus processing the mouse wheel); text and fonts (TrueType and OpenType fonts, antialiasing, measuring text); using timers; date and time APIs; a sample code for clocks; drawing and transforming images (displaying JPG and BMP files); simple animation; basic control programming (buttons, labels, scroll bars, and track bars); exploring Bezier curves and splines; menus (basic and custom); graphics paths and regions; clipping techniques; basic dialog box programming (modal and modeless forms); edit, list, and spin controls; font transforms and special effects, using toolbars and status bars, printing techniques (including print dialogs), splitter, TreeView, and ListView controls; programming with the clipboard, drag-and-drop support, reference sections on APIs for programming with files and streams, math functions, and strings.

</h3>Aimed at aspiring C# programmers of all levels, legendary Windows expert Charles Petzold''s <I>Programming Windows with C#</I> provides an extremely in-depth and intelligent tutorial to the APIs underpinning Microsoft''s .NET Framework.<p>For a generation of programmers, Petzold''s <I>Programming Windows: The Definitive Guide to the Win32 API</I> provided a virtual bible on how to get started with Windows development. This massive, handsomely bound hardcover edition attempts the same breadth of coverage for Microsoft''s new C# language and the new .NET. With several examples clearly inspired by the earlier C title, this book demonstrates the author''s keen eye for showing off and explaining the capabilities of low-level APIs to good effect.<p>The book first outlines basic "Hello World" examples for both a console and Windows Forms. Next, there''s coverage of basic support classes (like points and rectangles) before turning toward using these structures in extensive sections on graphics programming. Petzold''s traditional strengths as a computer author are in ample evidence here, with many short examples that exercise the capabilities of the new .NET APIs.<p>Veteran readers will recognize the basic shape of the early Win32 title in the organization of this (completely rewritten) C# version in the flow of topics from graphics, keyboard, mouse and timers, and the like. (One production note here is that the order of later chapters does jump around somewhat, circling back to graphics topics several times instead of presenting related APIs in order.)<p>The sections on graphics transforms and how to manipulate images are worthy of note. There''s excellent coverage of the possibilities of working with text and fonts output in .NET. Nifty working samples for several types of clocks and shape-drawing demos will let you explore graphical APIs in detail.<p>Several chapters cover basic Windows Forms control programming with buttons, labels, and edit controls and then splitters, ListView, and TreeView controls. This volume closes out with references to files and streams, and math and string APIs. For any developer who wants to create state-of-the-art, "traditional" client-side software, this book is sure to be required reading for its in-depth look at graphics and other leading-edge .NET features. It proves once again that learning low-level APIs in detail is still a good way to learn Windows programming. <I>--Richard Dragan</I>  <p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of C# and .NET Windows programming fundamentals; a "Hello World" console application; C# language and object basics; a simple Windows Forms application (creating a main window and handling the paint events); basic .NET structures (including rectangles, points, and colors); text output and scrolling; exploring .NET system information; in-depth tutorial for GDI+ programming: pens, lines, rectangles, and polygons; keyboard processing (plus a custom class for caret processing); graphics transformations (including scaling, linear transforms with matrices); mouse processing (plus processing the mouse wheel); text and fonts (TrueType and OpenType fonts, antialiasing, measuring text); using timers; date and time APIs; a sample code for clocks; drawing and transforming images (displaying JPG and BMP files); simple animation; basic control programming (buttons, labels, scroll bars, and track bars); exploring Bezier curves and splines; menus (basic and custom); graphics paths and regions; clipping techniques; basic dialog box programming (modal and modeless forms); edit, list, and spin controls; font transforms and special effects, using toolbars and status bars, printing techniques (including print dialogs), splitter, TreeView, and ListView controls; programming with the clipboard, drag-and-drop support, reference sections on APIs for programming with files and streams, math functions, and strings.

Written for readers with knowledge of C++, Inside ATL  surveys the strengths of today''s Active Template Library (ATL), used  for creating lightweight, high-performance COM components on  Windows. This book provides an excellent guide to ATL programming  while introducing all its features, both for client- and server-side  development.
 One of the best features of Inside ATL is its  thorough coverage of using (and understanding) the wizard-generated  code in Visual C++. The authors describe each of the choices  developers face when running these wizards, as well as examining and  modifying the generated boilerplate code. (You''ll find good detail on  the various threading options available with ATL components.) The book  also provides an excellent discussion of smart pointers and C++  templates to explain how ATL works by analogy. Another notable section  is the full treatment of using ATL to build efficient client-side  ActiveX components. (This last chapter alone will justify the cost of  the book for many readers.)
 Instead of long coding examples,  Inside ATL is filled with shorter excerpts used to illustrate  essential COM topics effectively. A complete example shows how to use  ATL for efficient client-side ActiveX components, including using  property pages and events. The book also covers ATL support classes  available for both client-side and server-side programming, and it  illustrates the use of ATL in writing Windows applications. A final  section on Windows 2000 and COM+ looks at the future of ATL in the  enterprise.
 With the solid knowledge of two experts from the field  of component development, Inside ATL does a fine job of  exposing the most important inner workings of ATL. Its mix of savvy  detail and thorough introduction to virtually every capability of ATL  will allow this book to fill a critical niche for every C++  developer. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: COM  basics, smart pointers, ATL wizards, threading apartment models, COM  servers and client-side components, aggregation, wizards, building  ActiveX controls, ATL window classes and collections, and COM+.

Product Description
Early chapters give an overview of COM and the use of ATL to develop components, controls, and document objects. Subsequent chapters analyze the key design considerations and explore specific programming techniques for such projects as tear-off interfaces, out-of-proc servers, and applications. Concluding chapters cover debugging and more advanced topics. Finally, the enclosed CD-ROM supplies programmers with the book''s sample code as well as abundant sample controls and components.

Written for the advanced C++ programmer, ATL Internals  reveals the inner workings of the Active Template Library (ATL), the  toolkit of choice for building today''s lightweight Internet and server  components.
 The book begins with a tour of the ATL code generated  by the Microsoft Visual C++ 6 AppWizard. The authors introduce  fundamental ATL programming issues here, but they do not provide a  general introduction to COM or ATL; they assume that readers have a  good deal of background in both C++ and COM.
 The book focuses on  the extremely useful ATL support classes for managing strings (BSTRs),  variants, and smart pointers. It covers the classes that help  instantiate COM components (and examines support for different  threading models and "creator" classes). The guide continues with  object internals--covering object maps and the classes used to manage  them--and interfaces, including aggregates and various interface  design options. Information on ATL''s support for persistence, which  lets objects save and restore their state; on how ATL supports basic  containers; and on interfaces that work with the Standard Template  Library (STL) in C++ is well done.
 Later sections explain how to  work with windows and ActiveX controls. After some material on events  (and connection points), the authors reveal ATL support for basic  window operations, including dialogs. For building a custom ActiveX  control, the authors provide an excellent example of a nicely  functional visual control. (This code will prove invaluable since it  illustrates all the essentials of ATL component programming.)  --Richard DraganProduct Description
ActiveX controls are a Microsoft technology that allows   developers to reuse components.  The ActiveX Template Library (ATL) is a   C++ library of class and function templates.  ATL is a faster,   easier-to-learn alternative to Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), that   allows Windows programmers to produce compact code quickly.     
This book provides practical solutions for programmers, and explains   these solutions on a detailed, technical level -- keeping the technology in   a real-world context that many books lack.  Programmers will learn how to   create new ActiveX controls using ATL, and how to modify the thousands of   available ActiveX controls to fit specific needs.     
Written by well-respected writer and teacher Brent Rector along with   DevelopMentor''s Chris Sells,  the content of this book has been taught in   courses for the Technology Exchange Company and Wise Owl Consulting.  The   book covers the latest version of ATL, 2.1, a major revision.

Given its patient and comprehensive tutorial style, Professional C# is a great choice for any developer stepping up to the plate with C# and the Microsoft .NET platform. With plenty of material geared to the specific needs of C/C++, Java, and VB programmers, this thorough tutorial packs some worthwhile advice within a well-paced guide to what you''ll need to know to succeed with Microsoft''s newest programming language.
    Weighing in at over 1,300 pages, this text delivers a wealth of material on C# from a team of expert Wrox authors. It does a good job of covering all the necessary language and runtime features of C#. Early sections look at what''s new and better in .NET, and then it''s on to a close look at C# as an object-oriented language. A real strength of this title has to be its tutorial style, which works patiently to bring developers of all stripes to the brave new realm of C#. Material specifically geared to C++, Java, and VB programmers will let a wide range of readers learn C# effectively. (Concise appendices tailored to all three types of users show what''s different about C# in comparison to these older languages.)
    After covering the basics of C# itself, the book then zeros in on the APIs of the .NET platform. From basic string handling, collections, and support for Internet programming to material on graphics, you''ll gain a command of some essential classes for everyday development. Sections on late-breaking standards and technologies like XML and Web services will help ensure that you get the most out of .NET.
    Coverage of database APIs (with ADO.NET) and server-side programming (with ASP.NET) rounds out the tour. More specialized topics show how to create Windows services, and how to work with the older COM/COM+ standards in Windows. You''ll also learn to work with corporate directories (via Active Directory) and the Windows Registry. C++ programmers in particular will appreciate the guide to class design in C#, which includes all relevant features in the newer language clearly spelled out.
    Bundling a wealth of information on both C# and .NET, Professional C# provides a state-of-the-art tour of what''s next for Windows programming. Regardless of whether you are coming to C# from a C/C++, Java, or VB background, this far-ranging yet thoroughly approachable guide can help you master the essentials of C# and the new .NET in record time. --Richard Dragan

Aimed at those with some previous programming experience, Inside C# shows developers the unique strengths, advantages, and tips for coding with C#. This fast-paced and in-depth tutorial will let you use Microsoft''s newest programming language on the emerging .NET platform successfully.
    The outstanding strength of this text is its in-depth language tutorial on C#, with complete coverage of basic and advanced object-oriented programming techniques. New language features like properties, indexers, and attributes get full coverage, alongside the basics of using classes and inheritance. 
    The book relies on using Visual Studio 6.0 and the command-line .NET tools for running programs. (Visual Studio.NET, the next version of Visual Studio, was unavailable when the book was written.) First to market with an in-depth language tutorial, the focus of Inside C# is on basic and advanced language features. By viewing generated code (using the ILDASM disassembler tool), the author examines how class design features work under the hood. 
    The language tutorial digs into features, beginning with a "Hello, World" program and delving into class design features before moving on to more basic features like expressions, operators, and flow control. This sequence makes the book best suited to the experienced developer, since some excellent in-depth material on the most advanced features of C# is presented before the basics of the language. Throughout, you''ll learn the newest features of the language, how to use it, and a sense of its personality.
    There''s also plenty of material on the underlying Microsoft .NET platform, from the basics of the Common Language Runtime (CLR) to assemblies (used to deploy .NET applications), plus getting older COM components to interoperate with the newer .NET standard. 
    For anyone who''s programmed before and wants to learn C# quickly, this in-depth guide anchored with plenty of short, effective examples provides what you need. Inside C# shows off the unique strengths of this new and exciting language and provides a solid introduction to the .NET platform. --Richard Dragan

For anyone who writes scripts in the awk family of languages, the third edition of Effective awk Programming provides an in-depth guide to processing text files with plenty of working sample code. Whether you are starting out with awk or are an experienced developer, this book will help you extend the reach of your awk scripts.
    This tutorial covers the entire spectrum of awk script development: From the basics of opening, searching, and transforming text files, to a comprehensive tutorial for regular expressions, to more advanced features like internetworking. The focus is on the practical side of creating and running awk scripts, and there''s plenty of hands-on advice for installing and running today''s awk (and gawk).
    The book begins with the fundamentals of awk for opening and transforming text flat files. The coverage of regular expressions, from simple rules for matching text to more advanced options, is particularly solid. You learn how to add variables and expressions for more intelligent awk scripts, plus how to parse data into records and fields. You''ll also find out how to redirect output from awk scripts to other programs, a useful technique that can cause awk to get a lot more done in real applications.
    Later, you learn several valuable sample awk scripts that mimic existing Unix utilities (like grep, id, and split), plus samples for counting words in documents and printing mailing labels, and even a stream editor. This grab bag of sample code lets you try out the techniques presented earlier in the book. Other sections look at support for networking in today''s gawk; for example, how gawk can read and write to URLs on the network almost just as easily as local files. Full sample code will teach the beginner or expert how to get productive with networks and awk. Final appendices trace the evolution of the awk language and show you how to download and install gawk.
    Suitable for beginner and experienced awk developers, Effective awk Programming, Third Edition, is an extremely worthwhile source of information on a wide range of programming techniques for today''s awk. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered:Introduction to the awk programming language Running awk scripts Basic file processing Tutorial for regular expressions Strategies for matching text Dynamic regular expressions Parsing data into records and lines (including separating fields and handling multiple-line records) Using print and printf for printed output with awk (including format specifiers) Redirecting awk scripts output to other processes Basic and advanced awk expressions (constants, variables, and function calls) Patterns Shell variables and actions Arrays (including multidimensional arrays and sorting) Built-in and custom awk functions Internationalizing and localizing awk scripts Advanced gawk (communicating with other processes and networking programming) Running awk and gawk Sample awk scripts Internetworking with awk History and evolution of awk Downloading and installing gawkProduct Description
Effective awk Programming provides complete coverage of the gawk 3.1 language as well as the most up-to-date coverage of the  POSIX standard for awk available anywhere. Author Arnold Robbins  clearly distinguishes standard awk features from GNU awk(gawk)-specific features, shines light into many of the "dark  corners" of the language, and devotes two full chapters to example  programs. A brand new chapter is devoted to TCP/IP networking with gawk.   As the official "User''s Guide" for the GNU implementation of awk (gawk), it describes in an integrated fashion the  extensions available to the System V Release 4 version of awk  that are also available in gawk. The book is also available  electronically, and can be freely copied and distributed under the terms  of the Free Software Foundation''s Free Documentation License (FDL). A  portion of the proceeds from sales of this book will go to the Free  Software Foundation to support further development of free and open  source software.

— Joseph Walrave

Beginning C# Objects: From Concepts to Code is a comprehensive yet approachable guide for anyone interested in learning the C# language, beginning with the basics.
To begin, this book addresses the two fundamental concepts that programmers must grasp in order to write a professional object-oriented C# application: the nature and characteristics of objects, and the structure that allows you to take best advantage of C#''s object-oriented makeup. 
  In addition to the basics of C# syntax, this book introduces object terminology&emdash;teaching you how to think in terms of objects&emdash;and provides an introduction of object modeling, illustrating how to translate an object model into C# code with ease.
  For folks who have already attempted to learn C# but are still having trouble mastering C#''s object-oriented nature, the case study format of this book will be invaluable in showing you how to translate a UML model into a fully-functional C# application.
  An overwhelming number of programmers are now moving to C# as their language of choice for developing powerful, maintainable, scalabe software applications. Whether you''re learning C# as your first programming language, moving to C# from a non-object-oriented language, or have previously programmed with C# but still feel unsure when it comes to object aspects, this book is a perfect fit for you.', N'<h3 class="review">Product Description

This text strikes an excellent balance between a   basic language tutorial with an authoritative presentation of what''s   new and better in .NET with coverage of the some of the inner details   of the platform, including deployment. The author''s patient writing   style is never dull or overly technical, which will mean this book is a   good choice for a wide range of readers approaching C# from a variety   of languages including C++, Java, and Visual Basic.
At certain   points, the author looks at "intermediate language" (IL) bytecodes that   underlie the C# language. This is particularly informative in chapters   that look at assemblies and deployment. As a tour of the basics of the   C# language, this book distinguishes itself with short, effective   examples (many of which use a set of classes modeling cars). Coverage   of programming Windows Forms is really good, as is the chapter on   getting the older COM and .NET components to interoperate. The focus of   this book is mostly on traditional client-side development, though it   does cover the latest in Web development with sections on basic ASP.NET   and Web services, which round out the book.
The author does a good   job at explaining how .NET works while bringing readers of different   abilities up to speed with C#. Experts will appreciate the detail on   class design, COM, and Web services, while beginners will be able to   follow the author''s well-organized tour of the basics. In all, this   combination of strengths makes C# and the .NET Platform an   attractive choice in the growing list of titles on Microsoft''s latest   programming language. --Richard Dragan

C# is the native language for Microsoft''s .NET platform. In this book, Andrew Troelsen shows you how to use C# for developing virtually every possible kind of .NET application. From Windows-based to Web-based applications, it''s all here. This book includes detailed discussions of every aspect of .NET development and useful examples with real code.    

Relentlessly practical and complete, C# and the.NET Platform  begins with a brief overview of the C# language and then quickly moves to the key technical and architectural issues facing .NET developers. Troelsen covers the .NET framework intensively, and even includes coverage of trickier areas, such as proper thread usage. You will learn to use C# for GUI applications, and you''ll receive a complete discussion of Windows Forms and GDI+. This book contains useful discussions on how to use C# and .NET for Web development, Web Services, and data access using ADO.NET. Troelsen even includes complete coverage of the subtler issues involving .NET and COM interoperability.     

Written in the same five-star style as his previous titles, this book is to many the final word in C# and .NET development. See what the experts have to say:

If you want to learn Microsoft''s new C# programming language quickly, you can perhaps do no better than C# Essentials, a compact and extremely intelligent guide.
    While most of today''s programming books seem to be trying to outdo one another in sheer page count, this one bucks the trend with an extremely concise--yet entirely thorough--treatment of C#. This is an efficiently packed, language-based guide that''s perfect for those with some previous object-oriented programming experience. It covers all C# language keywords, with particular attention to class design constructs. Short code excerpts, rather than full-length programs, are used to illustrate every feature of the language, from basic design types to data types, class design constructs (including all the details of inheritance), and the basics of the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR). You''ll learn how to model classes correctly using the most advanced features (such as reflection and attributes) that help make C# particularly powerful and elegant.
    Advanced topics include a guide to making Win32 API calls from within C#, new threading options, and how to interoperate with legacy DLLs and COM objects in C#. At just 200 pages, this text still manages to cover a lot of ground with the specifics of C#, and with many of the features that help give C# its personality as a programming language. 
    Admirably concise, yet filled with expert knowledge for exploiting both basic and advanced features, this title earns high marks as a tutorial for learning Microsoft''s latest programming language. It''s sure to be a useful choice for any experienced programmer tackling C# for the first time. --Richard Dragan

The standard by which all other CORBA books are judged,  Client/Server Programming with Java and CORBA is the book to  read if you''re thinking about doing anything with this language-  bridging technology. Working toward the Object Web, a computing  phenomenon in which the Internet is full of code modules that users  can assemble in many different ways to suit their needs, Orfali and  Harkey explain the Common Object Request Brokerage Architecture  (CORBA), which goes a long way toward realizing that goal. This book  is the single best CORBA resource available anywhere. Appropriately  enough, the book opens with a comparison of the client/server  architectures of Java and CORBA. It then goes on to cover dynamic  invocations of CORBA objects. There''s a discussion of the trade-offs  involved in choosing among sockets, HTTP/CGI, remote method invocation  (RMI), and CORBA/IIOP, complete with a table that compares the  features of all the competitors. The authors then explore the relative  advantages and disadvantages of two- and three-tier database query  systems under JDBC. The book concludes with a fully implemented  client/server transaction-handling system. The authors'' prose and code  is lucid and complete, and all of the numerous code samples appear on  the companion CD-ROM.

First published in 1997, Instant CORBA provides a  solid, extremely readable introduction to the world of distributed  objects using CORBA and Java on the Web. Written by three CORBA  experts, this book remains an extremely approachable introduction to  CORBA basics for any manager or programmer trying to make sense of  distributed computing using CORBA objects, Java, and the Internet.
  The best thing about this book is its remarkably friendly explanation  of the basics of CORBA, along with appropriate detail on what  distributed objects are and what advantages they offer for distributed  computing on the middle tier. There is excellent material on built-in  CORBA interfaces (called CORBAservices), including the basics of  creating and managing objects, as well as using transactions with the  Object Transaction Service (OTS). For over a dozen CORBA services, the  authors provide nicely readable scenarios (rendered in sequence  diagrams) for the use and interaction of CORBA objects and  services. (Another standout here is a long chapter on security in a  distributed setting, including a discussion of authentication, audit  trails, and non-repudiation, an essential legal requirement of  e- commerce.)
 Though some of this enthusiastically written  book''s prognostications (such as the ascendancy of CORBA-based  "intergalactic objects" and "shippable places" on the Web) haven''t  quite come to pass, the strengths of Java and CORBA are indeed more  and more obvious to many organizations. Though it shows off a few gray  hairs here and there (with quite a few references to CORBA products  from 1996-97), Instant CORBA still manages to deliver a lively  presentation of CORBA fundamentals suitable for any manager or  programmer who wants a thorough primer on this truly exciting  technology. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: CORBA  basics, business objects, CORBA on the Web, Java ORBs, static and  dynamic methods, Basic Object Adapter (BOA), IDL, CORBAservices,  Naming, Life Cycle and Event Services, Object Trader, Object  Transaction Service (OTS), security (authentication, audit trails,  non-repudiation), Persistent Object Service (POS), Query and  Collection Services, Relationship and Time Services, Licensing and  Property Services, CORBA 3, and compound document standards.

Though it shows off a few gray  hairs here and there (with quite a few references to CORBA products  from 1996-97), <I>Instant CORBA</I> still manages to deliver a lively  presentation of CORBA fundamentals suitable for any manager or  programmer who wants a thorough primer on this truly exciting  technology. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: CORBA  basics, business objects, CORBA on the Web, Java ORBs, static and  dynamic methods, Basic Object Adapter (BOA), IDL, CORBAservices,  Naming, Life Cycle and Event Services, Object Trader, Object  Transaction Service (OTS), security (authentication, audit trails,  non-repudiation), Persistent Object Service (POS), Query and  Collection Services, Relationship and Time Services, Licensing and  Property Services, CORBA 3, and compound document standards.

This is a thorough introduction to the world of Common Object  Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), which provides a framework for  building distributed systems, regardless of the hardware or software  platform. The authors point out that while other distributed computing  solutions (such as Microsoft''s DCOM) are vendor specific, CORBA is  maintained by the vendor-neutral Object Modeling Group (OMG) standards  body. This can be a blessing, but also a bane, since most  implementations of CORBA, as the authors note, do not implement all of  the CORBA specifications or implement it differently from product to  product.
 The authors treat CORBA as the ideal, looking at its  powerful Interface Definition Language (IDL), CORBA 2, which lets  software developers model objects and interfaces independent of  programming languages. (CORBA 2 also works with C/C++, Java, and  Smalltalk; the details are discussed early in the book.) Of course,  CORBA is not just a way to specify interfaces and the authors look  closely at the specification for CORBAservices, a object brokering  architecture model that is, at least in theory, a lot richer than  DCOM. The authors also explore CORBAdomains, which allow certain  interfaces for business objects within particular industries (such as  banking and health care) to be built and reused. The authors also  investigate CORBAfacilities, which allow applications to share  documents.
 The latter part of this book looks at the software  engineering process and discusses how analysts can adopt CORBA to  solve system architecture problems--mainly by retooling old systems  and making them work together. This section is a little vague and  though it introduces a case study, it doesn''t give much detail.
Inside CORBA is best for learning what CORBA is and why it is  the most mature technology for distributed processing that we  currently possess. Computer professionals who are considering building  (or rebuilding) a distributed computing information system will  appreciate this book.

The Component Object Model (COM) is deep and extremely  difficult, making it impossible to grasp the ideas behind this  specification quickly or easily. Don Box, the author of Essential  COM concedes that it took him six months of reading documentation,  writing programs, and experiencing general puzzlement before he had  his personal COM epiphany. Nonetheless, if you''re a C++ programmer and  you want your skills to continue to be relevant in a PC market  dominated by Windows 95 and Windows NT, you need to get going down the  path toward your own COM enlightenment. COM is the tool of choice for  creating distributed and concurrent systems for modern Microsoft  operating systems. If there''s a book that will help you get a handle  on the COM phenomenon, Essential COM is it.
 Endorsed by  object-orientation guru Grady Booch and Microsoft COM expert Charlie  Kindel, Box''s book takes the reader from an elucidating discussion of  why a demand exists for COM and how it fits into the progression of  C++ technology to a cool exhibition of some COM programs he''s  written. Along the way, Box covers the four corners of COM interfaces,  classes, apartments, and security--all explained in developer''s  detail. He also gives attention to access control, marshaling, and  Distributed COM (DCOM). Essential COM isn''t an application  programming interface (API) reference; it is an exploration of the Tao  of COM. As the author says in his preface, you will figure out the how  of COM programming quickly, as soon as you grasp the why.

Product Description
Written by a leading COM authority, this unique book reveals the   essence of COM, helping developers to truly understand the why, not   just the how, of COM. Understanding the motivation for the design of   COM and its distributed aspects is critical for developers who wish to   go beyond simplistic applications of COM and become truly effective COM   programmers. As the COM programming model continues to evolve, such   insight also becomes essential to remaining current with extensions,   such as Microsoft Transaction Server and COM+. By showing you why   Distributed COM works as it does, Don Box enables you to apply the   model creatively and effectively to everyday programming   problems.    
This book examines COM from the perspective of a C++   developer, offering a familiar frame of reference to ease you into the   topic. You will also find comprehensive coverage of the core concepts   of Distributed COM (interfaces, classes, apartments, and applications),   including detailed descriptions of COM theory, the C++ language   mapping, COM IDL (Interface Definition Language), the remoting   architecture, IUnknown, monikers, threads, marshalers, security, and   more. In addition, the book offers a thorough explanation of COM''s   basic vocabulary, provides a complete Distributed COM application to   illustrate programming techniques, and includes the author''s tested   library of COM utility code.

Written for the intermediate to advanced Visual Basic  developer, Distributed COM Applications Development Using Visual  Basic 6.0 ably demonstrates how VB can be used to write powerful,  scalable distributed applications using the distributed Component  Object Model (DCOM).
 The book begins by contrasting traditional  client/server computing with today''s n-tiered architectures (including  Microsoft''s three-tiered Distributed Internet Architecture [DNA]  approach). A general introduction to designing objects with Visual  Basic follows in which the author enlists a case study for a video  rental database. This includes a presentation of the best of user  interface design in VB (including working with TreeView and toolbar  controls).
 You don''t need to know much about TCP/IP to use DCOM, of  course, but a section on this popular Internet protocol with the  WinSock control provides some background material. 
 A full  introduction to programming databases with ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)  becomes incorporated into the video rental database example. After a  quick look at ActiveX controls, the book provides an overview of COM,  along with the benefits and potential risks of choosing between DCOM''s  (often perplexing) threading models. 
 After presenting material on  object linking and embedding (OLE) Automation, the book zeroes in on  creating DCOM components, data-aware VB objects with transactions and  MTS, and real-world deployment issues with DCOM. These chapters  provide a state-of-the-art guide to programming with Visual Basic in  ways recommended by Microsoft. 
 Armed with these robust DCOM  objects, the book next turns to the Web--first with ASPs and then with  VB WebClasses for generating browser-neutral Web pages on the fly. (A  final chapter looks at creating Active Documents out of VB forms for  use with Internet Explorer.) In all, this practically-minded text  provides a useful tour for real-world thin-client computing with VB  and DCOM. The book assures that today''s VB is all you need to write  scalable, Web-centric distributed components and applications for the  Microsoft platform. --Richard DraganProduct Description

</h3>Written for the intermediate to advanced Visual Basic  developer, <I>Distributed COM Applications Development Using Visual  Basic 6.0</I> ably demonstrates how VB can be used to write powerful,  scalable distributed applications using the distributed Component  Object Model (DCOM).<p> The book begins by contrasting traditional  client/server computing with today''s n-tiered architectures (including  Microsoft''s three-tiered Distributed Internet Architecture [DNA]  approach). A general introduction to designing objects with Visual  Basic follows in which the author enlists a case study for a video  rental database. This includes a presentation of the best of user  interface design in VB (including working with TreeView and toolbar  controls).<p> You don''t need to know much about TCP/IP to use DCOM, of  course, but a section on this popular Internet protocol with the  WinSock control provides some background material. <p> A full  introduction to programming databases with ActiveX Data Objects (ADO)  becomes incorporated into the video rental database example. After a  quick look at ActiveX controls, the book provides an overview of COM,  along with the benefits and potential risks of choosing between DCOM''s  (often perplexing) threading models. <p> After presenting material on  object linking and embedding (OLE) Automation, the book zeroes in on  creating DCOM components, data-aware VB objects with transactions and  MTS, and real-world deployment issues with DCOM.

Wrox specializes in books written by programmers, for  programmers. Professional Java Server Programming, a volume on  developing Java-based Web applications, is no different. All the 12  authors are developers and consultants--including some who''ve been  part of Sun''s own Java team.
 The Web is becoming more and more a  way of delivering applications rather than just static Web pages. Java  is becoming more and more popular as a tool for building Web  applications, thanks to Java servlets and Java Server  Pages. Professional Java Server Programming is a big book full  of code samples and real-world experience. 
 Starting with a  grounding in Web application development and technologies, the book  introduces the various concepts of using Java to deliver Web  content--as well as helping to give you the tools you need to work  around the limitations of Web servers and Web browsers. You''ll also  learn how to develop complex database-driven applications--and how to  work faster. Since this is a book on the cutting edge of Java  development, you''ll also find sections on using Java with XML  documents and LAP directory servers, as well as Enterprise Java  Beans. There''s even a good examination of the next generation of Java  technologies--Jini and JavaSpaces--with a look at how these can be  used in Web applications.
 This is a superb and extremely practical  book. If you''re building Java-based Web server applications, this is a  book you need to have next to your terminal, if only for the 300 pages  of reference material in the appendices! --Simon Bisson,  amazon.co.ukProduct Description
An overview of the new server-side Java platform - Java 2 Enterprise Edition - as it relates to building n-tier web applications.  It covers the building blocks (Servlets, JSP, EJB, JDBC, RMI, JNDI, CORBA) then goes into special design considerations for server side programming, (including resource pooling and component based design) before finally discussing future possibilities opened up by Jini and JavaSpaces technology.    
In a world where, increasingly, corporate IT development is Web application development - ASP, PHP, CGI and ISAPI are all viable options.Now, so is the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition, and that''s good news because server-side Java is portable across Windows, Linux, UNIX and MacOS and compatible with a wide range of Web Servers (IIS, Apache, Netscape Enterprise Server) and Application Servers from Sun, IBM and others.    
What does all this mean for you?  Java provides technologies to allow for server side processing,   dynamic page content generation and dynamic presentation.  With these comprehensive, platform independent Java class libraries you can join together the disparate pieces of your business - data, applications and platforms - to form a coherent whole.    
Java 2 Enterprise Edition - announced by Sun in June 1999 - makes Java an entire platform, not just another language and this is the first book that seriously covers it.

This brief guide to Dynamic HTML (DHTML) focuses on what you  can do with DHTML rather than the history and evolution of markup  languages. Author Jeff Rule has compiled his knowledge from his work  on the Discovery Channel Online site into a quick reference that lists  ways to spice up your Web pages.
 The book begins with a very quick  overview of the various technologies and standards that comprise DHTML  and a peek at the Netscape, Microsoft, and World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C) Document Object Models. Rule then explains cascading style  sheets (CSS), with a welcome focus on how they work in today''s  browsers. The book continues with a series of chapters devoted to the  various tricks you can perform with DHTML: navigation effects,  transitions and filters, resizing graphics, and pull-down and pop-up  menus. Throughout these chapters, the author provides links to example  Web sites, including his own comprehensive site.
 Animations, drag  and drop, timelines, and sequencing are also covered with a balanced  discussion of the Netscape and Microsoft approaches to each. The  author then devotes a chapter to the ActiveX multimedia controls in  Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 and another to the sticky issue of font  management. The book concludes with explanations of how to utilize  push technology, a preview of the version 5 browsers, and thoughts on  the future direction of the Web. If you want to skip the lengthy  tutorials and dive right into DHTML, this is the book for  you. --Stephen W PlainProduct Description
This concise and readable tutorial and reference is just what web developers need to ease the learning curve for the exciting new technology called DHTML. It helps them understand the principles behind DHTML and acquire techniques for effective DHTML scripting using a unique learn-by-example approach. Not only do the examples contained in the book explain and illustrate theory, they can be plugged into existing web pages to create instant dynamic effects, such as pull-down menus, animations, pop-out menus, transitions, filters, and drag and drop. The book explains all of the key topics, including DOM (Document Object Model), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), essential technologies contributing to DHTML. Rule covers both Microsoft''s and Netscape''s implementations.

You''re not alone.     
At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don''t want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who''ve faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on... something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun.    
You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don''t just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look "in the wild".  In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java''s built-in pattern support in your own code.    
You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead).  You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you''re up a creek without a design paddle pattern.    
Most importantly, you want to learn the "secret language" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You''ll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn''t as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter.    
With Head First Design Patterns, you''ll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the "Trading Spaces" show. Best of all, in a way that won''t put you to sleep!  We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts.    
If you''ve read a Head First book, you know what to expect -  a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.

Often referred to as the "black art" because of its complexity and uncertainty, software estimation is not as hard or mysterious as people think. However, the art of how to create effective cost and schedule estimates has not been very well publicized. While the average software organization can struggle with project costs that run double their original estimates, some of the more sophisticated organizations achieve results with estimation errors as low as 5-10%. These best-in-class organizations use scientific techniques that are not cost-effective, however, making them of limited use to most software development organizations. To address these issues, Software Estimation focuses on the art of software estimation and provides a proven set of procedures and heuristics that software developers, technical leads, and project managers can apply to their projects. Instead of arcane treatises and rigid modeling techniques, award-winning author Steve McConnell gives practical guidance to help organizations achieve basic estimation proficiency and lay the groundwork to continue improving project cost estimates. This book is organized from simple tips to more advanced ideas; it does not avoid the more hairy mathematical estimation approaches, but the non-mathematical reader will find plenty of useful guidelines without getting bogged down in complex formulas.

Aimed at the more experienced Java Web developer, Advanced JavaServer Pages covers leading-edge techniques for writing more maintainable Web applications in Java. Stressing custom tag libraries and other reusable components, this book is all you need to take your programming skills to the next level.
    There are any number of good introductory texts on JavaServer Pages. This title distinguishes itself with techniques recommended by Sun for building better Web applications. Backed up by the author''s own collection of custom tag libraries, which allow ordinary Web designers to program with tags instead of Java code, this text covers all the bases from getting started with tags to more advanced techniques. Early examples of tag libraries include a variety of ways to validate data in HTML forms. Throughout, the book deftly describes installing tag libraries, and shows how HTML designers can use custom tags after Java developers have created them.
    Readers also get best practices for JSP and Beans, which is a big plus. Author David Geary presents both Model 1 and Model 2 architectures. (In Model 1, JavaBeans are used to present data to front-end JSPs. In Model 2, a more sophisticated set of Java classes using the Model-View-Controller design pattern allows even greater flexibility.) Sample code for using JSP and JavaBeans for internationalized code (including French, German, and Chinese) will show you how to take your Web application to worldwide markets. The book concludes with a working case study of an online fruit stand (using several languages) and applies the techniques presented earlier on.
    All in all, with its mix of practical advice and some very useful techniques for getting the most out of JSP and Java for Web applications, Advanced JavaServer Pages fills a valuable niche for any serious Java developer who wants to see some of the best ways to create Web applications today. --Richard Dragan

Thousands of developers have discovered that JavaServer Pages represent the optimal solution for cross-platform web-based development. Now that they''ve mastered the basics of JSP, many are seeking to deepen and strengthen their expertise. In Advanced JavaServer Pages, best-selling Java author and former JavaSoft developer David Geary delivers the sophisticated enterprise-class techniques they''re searching for. Geary tackles JavaServer Pages 1.1 with the same exhaustive, authoritative approach that made his Graphic Java books so successful. He begins with a thorough review of JSP elements, servlets, and JavaBeans; then introduces custom and body tags; and offers sophisticated insights into JSP-based Web application design. Advanced JavaServer Pages includes detailed chapters on internationalization, security, databases, e-mail integration, and Enterprise JavaBeans.

Suitable for learning basic programming for Web browsers, Beginning JavaScript is a patient, introductory tutorial on writing scripts successfully. It teaches you how to create client-side scripts (including full coverage of fundamentals like variables and flow control, plus plenty of screen shots.)
    JavaScript is a good way to learn programming. It''s powerful, of course, but the book takes small steps, using scripts that work with string and time data first, and then moving to manipulating browser objects like forms and windows. A running case study for a trivia game helps anchor the steps with a practical (and fun) example. There are plenty of tips on debugging your scripts (including how to use the Microsoft Script Debugger tool), and each section includes sample questions. (The book also offers extensive answers in over 80 pages at the end of the book.)
    There''s plenty of material on the differences between Internet Explorer and Netscape, especially when it comes to Dynamic HTML (DHTML). Coverage of the Document Object Model (DOM) for browsers helps bring the text up to date on some of the latest standards in Web browsers (including the new Netscape 6).
    While the focus of Beginning JavaScript clearly is on the client, later sections turn to server-side ASP development (in which the sample trivia game is enhanced with ASPs written in JavaScript using ADO and Microsoft Access.) Reference sections on JavaScript and the browser object model for Internet Explorer and Netscape (through version 4.x) round out the material. 
    In all, with its approachable style and clearly rendered code examples, Beginning JavaScript makes for a worthwhile first book of programming for today''s browsers. Even if you haven''t programmed before, this text can give you the tools you need to bring your static Web pages to life. --Richard Dragan

Let''s pretend you''re a developer or manager looking for the  best ways to use Java technologies to solve a problem that requires  you to link diverse programs, databases, people, and  devices. Developing Java Enterprise Applications shows you what  these technologies can do, enabling you to decide which ones to  investigate more closely with experimentation and more specialized  books.
 Authors Stephen Asbury and Scott R. Weiner provide  information on seven Java technologies: Java Database Connectivity  (JDBC), Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI), JavaServer Pages  (JSPs), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs),  Java Messaging Service (JMS), and Java servlets. Throughout the book,  the authors demonstrate an awareness of the latest Java developments,  including aspects of the core packages that first appeared in Java  2.
 The authors use prose to explain the technologies from an  architectural point of view, detailing what each is good for and why  you''d want to use it. They then provide illustrative programs that  show how the technology works from a practical perspective. While  these illustrations aren''t enough to provide a full working knowledge  of the Java Enterprise APIs, they are enough to get programmers  oriented. After studying these examples, it''s possible to ask  intelligent questions about the various technologies and do effective  research.
 Despite the sequential approach to the APIs,  Developing Java Enterprise Applications does a fair job of  explaining how multiple enterprise technologies can be used together  for maximum effect. Concluding chapters present some fairly elaborate  applications--including a neat online store--that integrate elements  from several of the covered packages. --David WallProduct Description
Learn how to build sophisticated enterprise applications using the JavaTM Enterprise APIs. Stephen Asbury and Scott Weiner--two of Sun''s favorite Java programming trainers--provide easy-to-digest instruction for the major Java Enterprise APIs and their associated programming tools and products. They describe proven techniques for combining these APIs to create powerful enterprise applications and discuss the role middleware products play in the enterprise development process. You''ll learn how to: * Program with Java Enterprise APIs like RMI, Servlets, JDBC, JNDI, JTS, and others. * Build N-Tier, transaction applications with Enterprise JavaBeans. Create messaging applications with Java Messaging Service (JMS). * Build a servlet search engine for your Web site. * Create an online store with JavaServer Pages (JSP).

In his beautifully written and designed Java 2D API Graphics, Vincent Hardy introduces Java programmers to the contents and capabilities of this exciting addition to the set of standard Java classes.
 The Java 2-D API counts among the most significant recent additions to the Java platform. The API makes it relatively easy for the programmer to treat hardware devices (including video displays and printers) as abstractions, and simplifies the process of conceiving, manipulating, and displaying geometric figures. It also incorporates a sophisticated color model (with support for transparency) and allows programmers to manipulate styled characters with a far greater degree of precision (and with greater ease) than before. 
 The book coverage is thorough, and is sure to save developers time that would have been spent in figuring out details through experimentation. Hardy has earned special praise by including sequences of steps that illustrate how jobs get done in the Java 2-D API. For example, he summarizes the process of rendering to a printer with eight steps, compactly stating which classes need to be used, which interfaces you need to implement, and which methods you need to call. 
 There''s plenty of example code here (and on the companion CD-ROM), but Hardy doesn''t make you decode an example in situations in which a quick statement of procedure will work. He also makes great use of illustrations (to show how such phenomena as joins and end caps are calculated, for example) and mathematical formulas (to show how AffineTransforms work). Many of the illustrations are in color, a valuable feature. --David Wall
Topics covered: The Java 2-D API for programmers with experience elsewhere in the Java language. The author pays attention to the basics--such as manipulating and rendering shapes--but also goes into detail on the Graphics Layer Framework (GLF) and the advanced rendering capabilities of the Java 2-D API (including text layout, fancy light effects, photo manipulation, and the simulation of 3-D objects with light and shadow).

Product Description
Features hundreds of full-color graphics that demonstrate the power of the Java 2D API.  Covers 2D geometry rendering, text effects, image manipulation, color management, and compositing. Clearly explains how to use, combine and extend the rich features of Java 2D API.  Softcover. CD-ROM included.

Since the earliest days of Internet scripting, Web developers have considered JavaScript: The Definitive Guide an essential resource. David Flanagan''s approach, which combines tutorials and examples with easy-to-use syntax guides and object references, suits the typical programmer''s requirements nicely. The brand-new fourth edition of Flanagan''s "Rhino Book" includes coverage of JavaScript 1.5, JScript 5.5, ECMAScript 3, and the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 standard from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Interestingly, the author has shifted away from specifying--as he did in earlier editions--what browsers support each bit of the language. Rather than say Netscape 3.0 supports the Image object while Internet Explorer 3.0 does not, he specifies that JavaScript 1.1 and JScript 3.0 support Image. More usefully, he specifies the contents of independent standards like ECMAScript, which encourages scripters to write applications for these standards and browser vendors to support them. As Flanagan says, JavaScript and its related subjects are very complex in their pure forms. It''s impossible to keep track of the differences among half a dozen vendors'' generally similar implementations. Nonetheless, a lot of examples make reference to specific browsers'' capabilities.
    Though he does not cover server-side APIs, Flanagan has chosen to separate coverage of core JavaScript (all the keywords, general syntax, and utility objects like Array) from coverage of client-side JavaScript (which includes objects, like History and Event, that have to do with Web browsers and users'' interactions with them. This approach makes this book useful to people using JavaScript for applications other than Web pages. By the way, the other classic JavaScript text--Danny Goodman''s JavaScript Bible--isn''t as current as this book, but it''s still a fantastic (and perhaps somewhat more novice-friendly) guide to the JavaScript language and its capabilities. --David Wall
Topics covered: The JavaScript language (version 1.0 through version 1.5) and its relatives, JScript and ECMAScript, as well as the W3C DOM standards they''re often used to manipulate. Tutorial sections show how to program in JavaScript, while reference sections summarize syntax and options while providing copious code examples.

Product Description
JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be embedded directly in HTML; it allows you to create dynamic, interactive Web-based applications that run completely within a Web browser.JavaScript: The Definitive Guide provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and its client-side framework, complete with sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks. The book also contains a definitive, in-depth reference section that covers every core and client-side JavaScript function, object, method, property, constructor, and event handler.  This third edition of JavaScript: The Definitive Guide describes the latest version of the language, JavaScript 1.2, as supported by Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4. The book also covers JavaScript 1.1, which is the first industry-standard version known as ECMAScript.

JavaScript is the language of the web, used in programming all the major browsers. It is a powerful scripting language that lets web developers produce more powerful, more user-friendly and more interactive web pages, and with the release of the Version 5 browsers its power will become even greater. JavaScript is not just for client-side, however; it''s increasingly finding favour as a server side programming language- in Microsoft''s ASP technology- and as a programming language for administration tasks with applications such as the Windows Scripting Host.
 This book covers the broad spectrum of programming JavaScript - from the core language to browser applications and server-side use to stand-alone and embedded JavaScript. It includes a guide to the language - when where and how to get the most out of JavaScript - together with practical case studies demonstrating JavaScript in action.

Despite its wordy title, Professional Java 2 Enterprise Edition with   BEA WebLogic Server actually is one of the better books that you can get for   learning JSP-based programming with Java and Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs). By   highlighting practical matters--including setting up and running the popular BEA   WebLogic Server, and benchmarking performance--the authors manage to cover the   essentials of EJB-based development in a friendly and intelligent style that''s   ideal for any aspiring Java EJB developer.
    The focus on hands-on matters begins with installation and configuration of BEA   WebLogic Server, one of the more widely used platforms for running EJB   applications. Most books cover EJBs more theoretically and leave deployment by   the wayside. By focusing on an actual EJB product, the authors can talk about   what works and what doesn''t work in real applications. For examples, a single   case study for a chain of pizza shops gets enhanced in stages, first with a Web   front end for ordering pizzas, then with other features--including call-center   support, e-mail, and XML. A section on converting an ASP version of a front end   for this sample application into a JSP version is a highlight.
    The latter half of this text turns into a primer on benchmarking. A benchmark   (called the Grinder) measures performance, with a wide range of choices   for EJBs that run on WebLogic. Different Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) and   choices for implementing the applications (for example, stateful vs. stateless   EJBs) are tested, and the numbers of concurrent users (up to 400) are varied.   The result is a solid glimpse into the choices that give the best performance on   WebLogic.
    Besides covering the basics of building e-commerce applications with JSPs and   EJBs, this book has a genuinely practical side. The case study is very useful,   as is the plentiful performance advice. Smart, friendly, and well organized,   this title strikes an excellent balance between presenting information on some   of the latest Java technology and APIs, and showing just how to do it on a real   EJB platform and with real code. --Richard Dragan

Technology Overview
  The Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) specification is one of Java''s success stories; a standard for enterprise web application development that has wide industry support.   
  J2EE is basically a collection of specifications for web services, business objects, data access, and messaging. They define the way in which web applications communicate with the servers that host them. J2EE focuses on two things - creating a standard that allows web applications to be portable between servers, and giving the server control of component lifecycle and other resources, in order that it can handle issues of scaling, concurrency, transaction management, and security.  
  This book is based around one of the most popular J2EE and EJB implementations, BEA WebLogic Server. The authors work for BEA in Europe, providing technical support for customer''s implementations of Weblogic-based solutions. They have first-hand knowledge of the practical difficulties developers face in applying J2EE and WebLogic to their projects, and in debugging and testing these applications. This book is a distillation of their real-world expertise.  
Who is this book for?
  This book is for professional Java developers who want to see the development of a full J2EE example and its configuration and deployment on BEA WebLogic Server. Coverage of the APIs involved, reasoning behind the architecture decisions made, and how the example is tested, is included.  
  Java knowledge is assumed, as is a basic tutorial understanding of the J2EE APIs. Some experience of enterprise level / web application programming is expected.  
What does this book cover?
  Moving a client/server app to the web using J2EE APIs  Interfacing multiple front ends to the underlying business logic  How to create business logic components with Enterprise JavaBeans  Using Java Message Service for reliable and broadcast messaging  WebLogic Server-specific programming and configuration detail  Security concerns for an e-commerce site  The Grinder, a stress-tester for web applications  Results of stress-tests compare application architectures under different loads  Full working example developed and tested in the book

While Jini promises to be a potential rival to CORBA and DCOM  for general distributed development, the focus of Core Jini is  on using the technology to connect peripherals to networks via  Java. 
 Traditional problems found in distributed computing--and how  Jini overcomes them--are tackled first. After this overview, there is  a simple "Hello World" example, as well as a solid guide to setting up  and running the Jini tools. Then the book delves into Jini specifics,  starting with "discovery" (which allows devices to find Jini services  on the fly). The book explains in detail how Jini services advertise  themselves using both multicast and unicast protocols. 
 Jini  services are "leased" by clients, and a section on Jini''s leasing  protocol shows the details from both the server side and client  side. All of the requirements for a "well-behaved" Jini service are  summarized, along with a complete example for a print service. Core  Jini gives the working Java developer all necessary technical  information to do this. --Richard Dragan
Topics  covered: Jini''s standard and custom attributes (and how to use  them with JavaBeans), lookup services in Jini (plus connection  scenarios), Jini remote events, the JavaSpaces API (for sharing data  between distributed processes), and distributed transactions.

Product Description
A Roadmap  
Part I of this book, "Foundations," provides some necessary background reading Jini. This information will be useful for savvy readers who just need to understand Jini, what it does, and how it works. But it''s also "required reading" for developers who want to build actual, running Jini programs--the chapters in this part highlight the philosophical differences between Jini and "classical" networked and distributed systems technologies. If you have a good understanding of this material, you''re ready to build software that''s consistent with the Jini aesthetic.  
Chapter 1, "A New Computing Paradigm," looks at the history and motivation of Jini. You''ll see how Jini is really the fulfillment of the original Java promise: of collections of software and hardware, working together simply and without administration. This chapter also covers the process of getting and installing the Jini software.  
Chapter 2, "Distributed Systems," provides a glimpse at the basics of distributed systems, and how Jini differs from traditional distributed systems software. Even if you''re a handy network programmer, you may want to take a look at this chapter. Jini is fairly unique in the distributed systems world, and it''s interesting to see the roots of Jini and understand what problems it''s good at solving.  
Chapter 3, "The Jini Model," introduces the basic concepts in Jini. Fortunately there are very few of these--only five. Understanding these concepts and how they connect to each other will make later reading much easier.  
Chapter 4, "Deployment Scenarios," covers some scenarios for deploying Jini services. These are development targets, if you will--ways that you as a developer can deploy Jini code that you write. Jini is perhaps unique in all the Java libraries provided by Sun, in that it is specifically designed to support devices which may not have Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) embedded in them. Jini can be used to connect devices with only limited computational ability, just as it can be used to connect large servers and other machines running full-fledged JVMs. This chapter will help you understand the options available to you if you''re designing for Jini.  
These first four chapters comprise Part I of this book--they provide a broad introduction to the Jini technology and how it fits into the world. Part II, "Building with Jini," is a very in-depth look at particular aspects of Jini. It is designed for the professional Java developer who is writing new Jini services or building Jini-enabled devices. Some of the chapters in this part are In Depth chapters that dive deeply into a particular aspect of the Jini technology. Others are structured around large examples that show Jini being applied to real problems.  
Chapter 5, "Getting Started with Jini," begins with a series of programs designed to introduce you to the core Jini concepts. This series is a set of "Hello, World" style programs that are evolved to illustrate ideas such as lookup, discovery, leasing, and remote events. This chapter is your first introduction to building Jini software from scratch, and covers almost all the basic Jini ideas, as well as an example of using the RMI activation framework.  
Chapter 6, "In Depth: Discovery," is an in-depth chapter looking at Jini''s discovery protocols. These are the means by which Jini services notify the world of their existence, and Jini client applications learn about the clusters or "communities" of services that are available to them. We''ll look under the hood at these protocols--understanding what''s really going on there is key to understanding how to use them effectively. By the end of this chapter you should understand these protocols well enough to be able to implement them "by hand" if you need to.  
Chapter 7, "Using Attributes to Describe Services," talks about the Jini notion of attributes . Attributes are objects that can be associated with services to provide descriptive information about them, or even provide additional functionality (such as user interfaces) to extend the behavior of services. This chapter talks about how to use attributes, and how the Jini attribute model meshes nicely with JavaBeans.  
Chapter 8, "In Depth: Using Lookup Services," moves on to the next major phase in a Jini application''s life cycle, the use of the Jini lookup service. Lookup is how applications learn about particular services within a particular community. In this in-depth chapter, you''ll see how both clients and services use lookup, and learn how to use some high-level "convenience" APIs to simplify the responsibilities of services with regard to lookup. We''ll pay special attention to the issues around federating and connecting Jini communities into larger structures.  
At this point you should understand the basics of what you need to know to build a very functional and useful Jini client application that can participate in the discovery and lookup process, and allow you to find and browse any Jini service on the network. Chapter 9, "A Jini Lookup Service Browser," introduces a long application that exercises the ideas in the previous chapters. This application is a browser that can find lookup servers and the services registered there, and allow you to view and control the attributes of those services. The code in this chapter builds up a toolkit of useful components for displaying and using service information, which you can reuse in your own applications.  
Chapter 10, "In Depth: Leasing," gives in-depth coverage of the notion of leasing, which is how Jini manages resources held by remote systems. Leasing is also the key to Jini''s ability to "self-heal" a large distributed system. In this chapter, we''ll talk about the benefits of leasing, and cover some common idioms that arise again and again when programming with leases.   
While Chapter 10''s focus is on the ideas behind leasing, and in particular how clients can use leasing, Chapter 11, "Exporting Leased Resources," talks about how Jini services can implement leasing. This is the other half of the leasing equation that is started in Chapter 10. With these two chapters, you can "close the loop," exporting a leased resource to a client, which then uses the lease consumer APIs to control it.  
While the chapters on discovery, lookup, and leasing provide the basics of what you have to do to write a functional Jini service, Chapter 12, "The Well-Behaved Service," provides a summary of the extra steps you can take to provide a useful and useable service. This chapter talks about service administration, the join protocol--which governs how services interact with their communities--and how to provide user interfaces for services.  
After this coverage of what it takes to be a "good" service, we''re ready to build a complete, sophisticated Jini application. Chapter 13, "A Complete Example: The Print Service," presents a long example of a service that allows clients to connect to it to print documents. This program supports administration, persistence, and self-description through attributes, and can serve as the basis for many of the services you will write. And, of course, you''ll be able to use this service in conjunction with the other examples in this book.  
Next, Chapter 14, "In Depth: Remote Events," provides a look at how Jini supports asynchronous notifications between programs. Jini extends the local Java event model with events that can be sent between objects in different JVMs. This remote event model has different semantics than the usual JavaBeans event model--this chapter looks at why this is, and explores some common idioms for using remote events. The remote event model lends itself to the creation of event "adaptors" that can plug into the event pipeline to provide such services as forwarding or storage of events. One of the examples here looks at an "event mailbox" adaptor that can be a useful service in many Jini communities.  
While the preceding chapters cover topics that are considered core and fundamental to Jini, the next two chapters are a bit different. The next chapters cover topics that are actually implemented as services atop the core Jini infrastructure.  
Chapter 15, "JavaSpaces," provides an introduction to Sun''s JavaSpaces service. This service provides an extremely useful object storage engine. Many applications that use Jini will need a way to store persistent data, and share it for use by other applications. JavaSpaces provides an easy object-based way for them to do this. And JavaSpaces can even serve as the basis for new styles of distributed computation. This chapter looks at the JavaSpaces programming model and philosophy.  
Chapter 16, "Distributed Transactions," covers transactions, which are one of the most technical concepts in Jini. Transactions are a way for cooperating processes to ensure the integrity of their data. Essentially, transactions are a way to make sure that either an entire set of operations happen completely, or that none of them happen at all. Those of you familiar with database programming are no doubt familiar with transactions, and their power in preventing partial failures. The Jini mod

The economics of the free software business has taken another football bounce with the release of O''Reilly''s Learning Red Hat Linux, a guide to the most popular distribution of the freely redistributable operating system. The bounce is this: for the typical tech-book list price of $35, you get Bill McCarty''s beginners'' survey and Red Hat 7.2, a $60 value at Red Hat''s own retail price. McCarty''s introduction claims that the two-CD set, printed with the O''Reilly logo, contains "everything you need to install and configure your own Red Hat Linux system." But is it really Red Hat 7.2? Yes, according to one Red Hat official, but like batteries, support is sold separately for $20 a month. Economics militate in favor of purchasing the book as well as a separate support contract from Red Hat, if needed. The book is, then, the freebie, and consequently a good deal.
McCarty follows his nose through the installation procedure and annotates each step with do''s and don''ts; e.g., do use the "custom" install mode rather than "server" or "workstation" if you don''t want to lose existing data on the hard drive. He intuits just what the new Linux user will want to do: configure X11, connect to ISP over a modem  or LAN, use e-mail, run Samba over the network to read a PC hard drive, configure and start an Apache Web server, and configure a basic firewall. His chapter on RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager, is brief but useful, and his one-page discussion of the Red Hat Network $20-a-month support option is far too brief to be useful, but contains enough hints to allow a new member to keep expectations modest.
Brevity and velocity are the book''s strengths, as McCarty glides from the highlights of one configuration protocol to another. Error recovery is ignored in favor of tips and hints on error avoidance. Larger issues in system administration strategies are unevenly treated: partitioning theory, dual booting, and backing up are skipped. Loading kernel modules dynamically is not discussed, and neither is kernel compiling, and the ubiquitous DHCP client is introduced only after the rather advanced DHCP server is discussed. To round out the knowledge base, I recommend Matt Welch''s peerless  Running Linux as the entry point for serious Linux system administration.
In his hurry, McCarty blurs distinctions between Linux distributions, leaving the reader wondering why Red Hat is singled out for book-length coverage. But his single biggest omission is an introduction to linuxdocs.org and the indispensable world of HOWTOs. Rather, reference to HOWTOs is relegated to an appendix on the boot process.
Ultimately, Learning Red Hat Linux should be viewed as an inexpensive way to obtain legitimate CDs of Red Hat 7.2, with installation documentation that exceeds the norm. Once the installation has either succeeded or failed, however, readers will want to move along to linuxdocs.org or Running Linux. --Peter LeopoldProduct Description
The third edition of Learning Red Hat Linux will ease into the world of Linux, guiding you through the process of installing and running Red Hat Linux on your PC.

</h3>The economics of the free software business has taken another football bounce with the release of O''Reilly''s <I>Learning Red Hat Linux</I>, a guide to the most popular distribution of the freely redistributable operating system. The bounce is this: for the typical tech-book list price of $35, you get Bill McCarty''s beginners'' survey <I>and</I> Red Hat 7.2, a $60 value at Red Hat''s own retail price. McCarty''s introduction claims that the two-CD set, printed with the O''Reilly logo, contains "everything you need to install and configure your own Red Hat Linux system." But is it really Red Hat 7.2? Yes, according to one Red Hat official, but like batteries, support is sold separately for $20 a month. Economics militate in favor of purchasing the book as well as a separate support contract from Red Hat, if needed. The book is, then, the freebie, and consequently a good deal.<p>McCarty follows his nose through the installation procedure and annotates each step with do''s and don''ts; e.g., do use the "custom" install mode rather than "server" or "workstation" if you don''t want to lose existing data on the hard drive. He intuits just what the new Linux user will want to do: configure X11, connect to ISP over a modem  or LAN, use e-mail, run Samba over the network to read a PC hard drive, configure and start an Apache Web server, and configure a basic firewall. His chapter on RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager, is brief but useful, and his one-page discussion of the Red Hat Network $20-a-month support option is far too brief to be useful, but contains enough hints to allow a new member to keep expectations modest.<p>Brevity and velocity are the book''s strengths, as McCarty glides from the highlights of one configuration protocol to another. Error recovery is ignored in favor of tips and hints on error avoidance. Larger issues in system administration strategies are unevenly treated: partitioning theory, dual booting, and backing up are skipped. Loading kernel modules dynamically is not discussed, and neither is kernel compiling, and the ubiquitous DHCP client is introduced only after the rather advanced DHCP server is discussed. To round out the knowledge base, I recommend Matt Welch''s peerless  <I>Running Linux</I> as the entry point for serious Linux system administration.<p>In his hurry, McCarty blurs distinctions between Linux distributions, leaving the reader wondering why Red Hat is singled out for book-length coverage. But his single biggest omission is an introduction to linuxdocs.org and the indispensable world of HOWTOs. Rather, reference to HOWTOs is relegated to an appendix on the boot process.<p>Ultimately, <I>Learning Red Hat Linux</I> should be viewed as an inexpensive way to obtain legitimate CDs of Red Hat 7.2, with installation documentation that exceeds the norm. Once the installation has either succeeded or failed, however, readers will want to move along to linuxdocs.org or <I>Running Linux</I>. <I>--Peter Leopold</I>

Sun Java certification is no picnic, so a thorough study guide  is essential. Look no further than The Complete Java 2  Certification Study Guide for formal, structured preparation. This  bulky title offers comprehensive coverage of the objectives you must  master to pass both the Programmer''s Exam and the more demanding  Developer''s Exam.
 Written by a trio of Sun Java course instructors,  this book uses a straightforward bottom-up approach, starting with  core syntax of Java and moving into progressively more graphical and  sophisticated aspects of development. The familiar textbook style  makes the title very suitable for self-paced study, even if you''re not  shooting for certification.
 Each chapter includes a test, and the  answers are explained. The authors use code snippets that are not  overwhelming in length to keep their readers focused on the concept at  hand. A large portion of the rear of the book is devoted to a Java 2  API reference, and the CD-ROM features a test limit to help you get  psyched for the big exam. If you''ve got the time and dedication to  master the material, this fine guide is all you need to get Sun''s  stamp of approval as a developer. --Stephen W. Plain
Topics covered: Java language fundamentals, objects and  classes, event management, components, graphical user interfaces,  database integration, thread management, and Remote Method Invocation  (RMI).

Aimed at the more experienced programmer tackling the new VB .NET for the first time, Andrew Troelsen''s Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Platform provides a quick-moving and intelligently rendered tour of .NET, with plenty of in-depth material on classes and object-oriented design. 
    Notably, this book is a direct translation of the author''s C# book, C# and the .NET Platform, using the same chapters and many examples ported from C# to VB .NET. Readers can thus rest assured that this is tried-and-true material.
    The author pitches the presentation at a fairly expert level, with plenty of coverage of object-oriented design, as well as a pretty thorough language tutorial. (The fact that it''s possible to show VB .NET using the same features as C# demonstrates that the languages are now equals on .NET.) Troelson''s tour offers good insight into the .NET Framework itself, with coverage of topics like Intermediate Language (IL), the Common Language Runtime (CLR), as well as deploying .NET components in assemblies. The book shows the three pillars of object-oriented programming--encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism--which are amply illustrated with code excerpts using objects for shapes, employee, and other simple classes. This book is also good at demonstrating how to get older COM and COM+ code to interoperate with new .NET components.
    Later chapters turn toward building user interfaces, whether through traditional clients using Windows Forms (and graphics programming), or using ASP.NET and Web Forms (for which the authors supply a solid introduction) for building Web-based, thin clients. Final sections look at Web services, which are just as easy to create in VB .NET as with any other supported .NET language.
    While this book assumes some programming knowledge on the part of the reader, it covers all the bases needed to use the new VB .NET and the .NET Framework effectively. It''s a worthy choice for getting onboard with .NET and will be appreciated by any new VB .NET developer, as well as C# and VB6 developers making the transition to Microsoft''s latest version. --Richard DraganProduct Description

Microsoft Visual Basic .NET provides the productivity features developers need to rapidly create enterprise-critical web applications. In Visual Basic .NET and the .NET Platform: An Advanced Guide, author Andrew Troelsen shows experienced developers how to use VB .NET for developing virtually every possible kind of .NET application. From Windows-based to web-based applications, ADO .NET, XML Web services, and object-oriented language features, it''s all here. There are detailed discussions of every aspect of .NET development and useful examples with no toy code.  
  Troelsen starts with a brief philosophy of the VB .NET language and then quickly moves to key technical and architectural issues for .NET developers. Not only is there extensive coverage of the .NET Framework, but Troelsen also describes the new object-oriented features of VB .NET including inheritance and interface-based programming techniques. You''ll also learn how to use VB .NET for object serialization, how to access data with ADO.NET, and how to build (and interact with) .NET Web Services, and how to access legacy COM applications.  
  Written in the same five-star style as Troelson''s previous two books, Developer''s Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0 and C# and the .NET Platform, this is the comprehensive book on using VB .NET to build .  ', N'<h3 class="review">Amazon.com Review

Written for the developer with previous programming and design  experience, Applying UML and Patterns combines UML, software  patterns, and Java to illustrate the author''s own design  strategy. Though author Craig Larman sometimes relies heavily on the  jargon of software engineering, there''s no doubt that his book  contains some immediately useful ideas on software design, using the  latest and greatest in software-engineering research.
 This book  begins by outlining a basic process of software design using  iterative, object-oriented techniques. The case study used for this  text is a point-of-sale (POS) system, a helpful real-world  example. The book constructs use case diagrams and basic conceptual  and class models for this system. The author then adds sequence  diagrams to show how the POS system will do its processing and  collaboration diagrams to show how objects will interact with one  another. The author uses standard UML diagrams to document the  design.
 When it comes to refining class design, the author''s  experience with patterns really shines. His General Responsibility  Assignment Software Patterns (GRASP) suggest guidelines for designing  classes that work together effectively. Larman believes that the  ability to assign responsibilities to classes effectively is one of  the most important aspects of good object-oriented design. His  patterns allow this to happen and provide an interesting contribution  to the design process. (The author also introduces more widely used  software patterns to enhance the design process.)
 When it comes to  coding the design, Java is the programming language of choice for this  text. Further chapters discuss how to refine an initial design using  an iterative process of software engineering. While it''s unlikely that  readers will adopt Larman''s approach to software design in its  entirety, his guidelines--and application of patterns to class design,  all documented using UML--make this a worthwhile text for the more  experienced reader. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Guides students through each step of requirements, analysis, design, and coding. Topics cover Expressing analysis and design models using the UML, a standard diagramming notation, Applying patterns to assign responsibilities and design collaborations and more. DLC: Object-oriented methods.

Combining some of today''s best ideas about customer-driven  object-oriented design, Use Case Driven Object Modeling with UML: A  Practical Approach shows you how to use Unified Modeling Language  (UML) in the real world, keeping with the author''s proprietary  software design process.
 The book begins with the genesis of the  author''s ICONIX Unified Object Modeling Approach, borrowing  ideas and strategies from the "three amigos" who invented UML: Grady  Booch, James Rumbaugh, and Ivar Jacobson. Throughout this text, the  ICONIX method is used to model a stock trading system, with all the  relevant UML diagrams, beginning with class definition and use  cases.
 The author''s approach to software relies heavily on customer  requirements and use case scenarios for which he has a good deal of  practical advice. He provides numerous hints for avoiding bogged-down  diagrams. After preliminary design, he advocates drilling down into  specifics with robustness diagrams, which trace how classes  interact with one another. The most detailed design work comes next  with sequence diagrams.
 Subsequent chapters offer tips on  project management, implementation, and testing. Throughout this  lively and intelligently organized book, the author presents numerous  real-world tips (and Top 10 lists) that supply wisdom to his  perspective on effective software design.
 Written for the reader  who already knows a little UML notation, Use Case Driven Object  Modeling with UML provides an appealing blueprint for the software  design success. --Richard DraganProduct Description

The second edition of Martin Fowler''s bestselling UML  Distilled provides updates to the Unified Modeling Language (UML)  without changing its basic formula for success. It is still arguably  the best resource for quick, no-nonsense explanations of using UML.
  The major strength of UML Distilled is its short, concise  presentation of the essentials of UML and where it fits within today''s  software development process. The book describes all the major UML  diagram types, what they''re for, and the basic notation involved in  creating and deciphering them. These diagrams include use cases; class  and interaction diagrams; collaborations; and state, activity, and  physical diagrams. The examples are always clear, and the explanations  cut to the fundamental design logic. 
 For the second edition, the  material has been reworked for use cases and activity diagrams, plus  there are numerous small tweaks throughout, including the latest UML  v. 1.3 standard. An appendix even traces the evolution of UML  versions.
 Working developers often don''t have time to keep up with  new innovations in software engineering. This new edition lets you get  acquainted with some of the best thinking about efficient  object-oriented software design using UML in a convenient format that  will be essential to anyone who designs software  professionally. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: UML  basics, analysis and design, outline development (software development  process), inception, elaboration, managing risks, construction,  transition, use case diagrams, class diagrams, interaction diagrams,  collaborations, state diagrams, activity diagrams, physical diagrams,  patterns, and refactoring basics.

Product Description
The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers identify the most important parts of the language. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions. Beginning with a summary of UML''s history, development, and rationale the book moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns.

It is still arguably  the best resource for quick, no-nonsense explanations of using UML.<p>  The major strength of <I>UML Distilled</I> is its short, concise  presentation of the essentials of UML and where it fits within today''s  software development process. The book describes all the major UML  diagram types, what they''re for, and the basic notation involved in  creating and deciphering them. These diagrams include use cases; class  and interaction diagrams; collaborations; and state, activity, and  physical diagrams. The examples are always clear, and the explanations  cut to the fundamental design logic. <p> For the second edition, the  material has been reworked for use cases and activity diagrams, plus  there are numerous small tweaks throughout, including the latest UML  v. 1.3 standard. An appendix even traces the evolution of UML  versions.<p> Working developers often don''t have time to keep up with  new innovations in software engineering. This new edition lets you get  acquainted with some of the best thinking about efficient  object-oriented software design using UML in a convenient format that  will be essential to anyone who designs software  professionally. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: UML  basics, analysis and design, outline development (software development  process), inception, elaboration, managing risks, construction,  transition, use case diagrams, class diagrams, interaction diagrams,  collaborations, state diagrams, activity diagrams, physical diagrams,  patterns, and refactoring basics.

<h3 class="review">Product Description
</h3>The award-winning first edition of UML Distilled was widely praised for being a concise guide to the core parts of the UML and has proved extremely successful in helping developers identify the most important parts of the language. UML Distilled, Second Edition, maintains the concise format with significantly updated coverage of use cases and activity diagrams, and expanded coverage of collaborations. It also includes a new appendix detailing the changes between UML versions. Beginning with a summary of UML''s history, development, and rationale the book moves into a discussion of how the UML can be integrated into the object-oriented development process. The primary author profiles the various modeling techniques in the UML--such as use cases, class diagrams, and interaction diagrams--and describes the notation and semantics clearly and succinctly. He also outlines useful non-UML techniques such as CRC cards and patterns.

Programming Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange is  a thorough guide for building collaborative applications such as  threaded discussions and electronic business documents. Early on, the  book describes four types of collaborative applications: messaging,  tracking, workflow, and real-time applications. Author Thomas Rizzo  shows the strengths of Microsoft Outlook and Exchange Server for  collaboration, including the many built-in security and administration  features.
 Rizzo also covers Outlook 98 development, explaining how  to customize folders, fields, and views (including rules and filtered  replication of messages). He then shows how to create Outlook forms,  with instruction on how to use components and add VBScript event  handlers. An account tracking application demonstrates all the basics  on this topic.
 The second half of the book is strong on building  Web-based collaborative applications and covers Web tools such as  Outlook Today and the Outlook HTML Form Converter. Collaboration Data  Objects (CDO) objects are fully explained, showing how they can be  built with ASPs and viewed in a browser. Rizzo provides excellent  samples for a help desk, a calendar of events, and an intranet news  application, and carefully lists the exact versions of various  Microsoft tools required to run each example successfully.
 The  book closes with material on the Event Scripting Agent and Exchange  Server Routing Objects, which provide fault-tolerant message  delivery. --Richard DraganProduct Description

The second edition of Jeff Prosise''s Programming Windows  with MFC is a great introduction to the programming language that  will help you build client-side applications in MFC. Though it doesn''t  cover Internet development, this title provides a worthy tutorial on  traditional MFC programming.
 After some MFC basics, the book looks  at Graphical Device Interface (GDI) graphics with a fine discussion of  drawing and font handling. Following this, Prosise introduces the use  of the MFC collection classes (an alternative to STL) and file I/O, as  well as adding serialization support to custom classes.
 He also  dedicates a fair amount of text to basic Windows controls and dialog  boxes. His tour of support for both the Single Document Interface  (SDI) and Multiple Document Interface (MDI) application styles is just  excellent. The built-in view classes in MFC and how to use them in a  Windows Explorer-style sample program are covered. From there, it''s on  to other common GUI interface models such as toolbars, status bars,  and the new Internet Explorer-style rebars. After a useful section on  printing (including some valuable real-world tips for this tricky  topic), the rich array of Windows common controls is discussed. As in  the first edition, Prosise''s introduction to MFC multithreading and  synchronization objects (like mutexes) is a standout.
 The last  section of the book provides a comprehensive discussion of COM and  ActiveX programming for the MFC developer. Although the Active  Template Library (ATL) is omitted here, there are fine examples of  building and using ActiveX controls, including the basics of OLE  automation.
 Newly revised with richer examples and the latest  Windows functionality, the second edition of Programming Windows  with MFC provides one of the best available tutorials for  traditional MFC development. --Richard DraganProduct Description
The newly updated and expanded second edition of this acclaimed  title covers 32-bit development for all Microsoft(r) Windows platforms,  including Windows 2000, using the Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC).  Aimed at developers who wish to capitalize on advances in the MFC for rapid,  object-oriented programming, the book delves into MFC basics, progresses to  the document/view architecture, then addresses advanced topics including  ActiveX(r), OLE, and COM. Author Jeff Prosise once again sets the standard  in describing the art of writing MFC-based Windows applications with his  clear and comprehensive treatment of concepts and techniques. Readers will  discover how to produce incredible functionality with little new code by  appropriating MFC code from the class library. They''ll also find sample  programs and executables on the book''s CD-ROM to further fuel their own  projects.

An authoritative text by one of the premier researchers in usability engineering in the 1990s, Jakob Nielsen''s Usability Engineering provides a landmark guide to software design that has helped bring this area of research into the mainstream of computing. "Usability" is the measurement of how easy or difficult it is to be productive with a piece of software. It often looks at the user interface--what elements appear onscreen and how efficient, confusing, and/or intuitive they are for beginning, intermediate, and advanced users. "Usability engineering" is the formal study of usability. It grew out of research on human factors, which looked at the way people interact with their environment.
 The best thing about this book is its concise, cut-to-the-chase approach when defining usability and ways to measure and improve it. As the author notes, in the old days of computing, documents that attempted to define usability might have over 1,000 rules. The author offers just a handful of guiding principles for creating better software that apply even today. (Published just before the Internet revolution, this book''s principles still hold true for Web designers, as well as those who create more traditional applications.)
 Throughout this text, the author argues for the benefits of improved software usability. With software use as with all things, time is money and making more efficient interfaces translates into lower personnel costs and more productivity. The book also does a fine job of integrating usability design into the software development process, with guides for planning, working with end users, and running tests with users (whether on videotape or in person). The 50-page bibliography attests to the author''s previous research on usability.
 For anyone who needs to create better, more efficient software, Usability Engineering can help. This clear and intelligent guide to the science of usability engineering has helped enhance the potential of computers to work with end users more efficiently. In the new century, software developers will undoubtedly seek new advances in usability, in part because of the groundwork laid by books like this one. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Usability basics, measuring usability, types of users, history of user interfaces, the usability engineering lifecycle, design techniques, heuristics and hints for improving usability, testing, managing user tests, assessing usability, interface standards, internationalization, and Computer-Aided Usability Engineering (CAUSE) tools.

Whom can you trust? Try Bruce Schneier, whose rare gift for common sense   makes his book Secrets and Lies: Digital Security in a Networked World both   enlightening and practical. He''s worked in cryptography and electronic security   for years, and has reached the depressing conclusion that even the loveliest   code and toughest hardware still will yield to attackers who exploit human   weaknesses in the users. The book is neatly divided into three parts, covering   the turn-of-the-century landscape of systems and threats, the technologies used   to protect and intercept data, and strategies for proper implementation of   security systems. Moving away from blind faith in prevention, Schneier advocates   swift detection and response to an attack, while maintaining firewalls and   other gateways to keep out the amateurs.
    Newcomers to the world of Schneier will be surprised at how funny he can be,   especially given a subject commonly perceived as quiet and dull. Whether he''s   analyzing the security issues of the rebels and the Death Star in Star   Wars or poking fun at the giant software and e-commerce companies that   consistently sacrifice security for sexier features, he''s one of the few tech   writers who can provoke laughter consistently. While moderately pessimistic on   the future of systems vulnerability, he goes on to relieve the reader''s tension   by comparing our electronic world to the equally insecure paper world we''ve   endured for centuries--a little smart-card fraud doesn''t seem so bad after all.   Despite his unfortunate (but brief) shill for his consulting company in the   book''s afterword, you can trust Schneier to dish the dirt in Secrets and   Lies. --Rob LightnerProduct Description

Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture: A System of  Patterns looks at how patterns occur on three different levels--in  software architecture, in everyday design, and in idioms (which  describe how a particular design pattern is implemented in a  programming language like C++). This synthetic approach is a little  theoretical at times, but the authors also present over a dozen  patterns and provide real-world examples wherever possible.
    For architectural patterns, the authors look at the Layers pattern,  used in operating systems such as Windows NT and virtual  machines. They also consider Pipes and Filters, which process streams  of data. (This pattern, the authors point out, is a lynchpin of Unix.)  Their Blackboard pattern shows how a complex problem, such as image or  speech recognition can be broken up into smaller, specialized  subsystems that work together to solve a problem. (For recognizing  words from a raw waveform input, a Blackboard approach might have  separate processes to find phonemes, then words, then sentences.)
  This book also looks at today''s distributed systems in considering the  Broker pattern, which is used on the Internet and in Microsoft''s OLE  technology.  This section also presents several powerful patterns for  building effective graphical user interfaces, such as  Model-View-Controller.
    The authors define several well-known design patterns, such as the  Proxy and Command patterns, and also basic, far-reaching patterns,  such as Whole-Part and Master-Slave, which are widely used throughout  computing. Their survey ends with a discussion on the way objects can  communicate (using such patterns as Forwarder-Receiver,  Client-Dispatcher-Server, and Publisher-Subscriber), which many  developers will recognize as familiar patterns, but are codified here  as "official" patterns. The book then discusses some idioms  in C++ and a more far-reaching role for patterns in software design  and architecture.  By fitting patterns into traditional software  engineering practices, the authors of Pattern-Oriented Software  Architecture successfully argue that the role for patterns will  only continue to diversify and enrich tomorrow''s software engineering  tools and methodologies. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Pattern-oriented software architecture is a new approach to software development. This book represents the progression and evolution of the pattern approach into a system of patterns capable of describing and documenting large-scale applications. A pattern system provides, on one level, a pool of proven solutions to many recurring design problems. On another it shows how to combine individual patterns into heterogeneous structures and as such it can be used to facilitate a constructive development of software systems. Uniquely, the patterns that are presented in this book span several levels of abstraction, from high-level architectural patterns and medium-level design patterns to low-level idioms. The intention of, and motivation for, this book is to support both novices and experts in software development. Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Novices will gain from the experience inherent in pattern descriptions and experts will hopefully make use of, add to, extend and modify patterns to tailor them to their own needs. None of the pattern descriptions are cast in stone and, just as they are borne from experience, it is expected that further use will feed in and refine individual patterns and produce an evolving system of patterns.

Imagine a world in which computers program other computers  based on strategies borrowed from biology and natural selection.  Genetic Programming: An Introduction explores fascinating  possibilities like these in a thriving area of computer-science  research. This research-quality book is for anyone who wants to see  what genetic programming is and what it can offer the future of  computing.
This text begins by situating genetic programming in  terms of the history of computing and machine learning. Early sections  show the links between Darwinism, molecular biology, and genetic  programming. (Genetic programming uses the strategy of natural  selection by solving a problem in successive iterations, which  produces the "fittest" solution, much like new species  evolve in the natural world.)
The authors present a lot of  molecular-biology background since it is central to the  genetic-programming project. (There are interesting parallels  here. Just as our DNA contains inert information, programs developed  using genetic algorithms usually contain many "extra"  instructions, too--which often leads to bloated, though effective,  code in the final product.) Even though this is extremely technical  material, the authors do manage to engage the reader in the  imaginative leap from Darwin and DNA to computers and the world of  genetic programming.
Later chapters define what genetic programming  is and what strategies it uses to let computers program  themselves. The authors also examine the state of the art of genetic  programming and define what problems need to be solved before it can  be widely adopted. The amount of research in this section will mostly  benefit specialists in the genetic-programming field.
A later  chapter on applications that use genetic programming offers dozens of  papers, with applications of this approach from a wide variety of  fields, including biology, industry, and computers (and some  impressive technologies such as robotics and data mining). Though the  authors exaggerate somewhat on how "real world" these  applications are, it''s clear that genetic programming will continue to  improve and find its way into more areas of computing--with even more  productive results. Though coding by humans is safe for the  foreseeable future, genetic programming offers an appealing  alternative to some kinds of problems. --Richard V. DraganProduct Description

Since the early 1990s, genetic programming (GP)Ã¢ÂÂa discipline whose goal is to enable the automatic generation of computer programsÃ¢ÂÂhas emerged as one of the most promising paradigms for fast, productive software development.   GP combines biological metaphors gleaned from Darwin''s theory of evolution with computer-science approaches drawn from the field of machine learning to create programs that are capable of adapting or recreating themselves for open-ended tasks.
This unique introduction to GP provides a detailed overview of the subject and its antecedents, with extensive references to the published and online literature.  In addition to explaining the fundamental theory and important algorithms, the text includes practical discussions covering a wealth of potential applications and real-world implementation techniques.  Software professionals needing to understand and apply GP concepts will find this book an invaluable practical and theoretical guide.

Professional Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects is an  intelligent guide to component design for anyone who builds Visual  Basic (VB) components. This is an authoritative guide to creating  state-of-the-art scalable distributed components with Visual Basic 6,  and it takes full advantage of the Microsoft Distributed interNet  Architecture (DNA) platform.
 The heart of this text is the author''s  design philosophy for building distributed components with VB, which  he calls his Component-based Scalable Logical Architecture (CSLA). The  author shows how to design objects that take full advantage of some of  the latest Microsoft features and tools. (The examples in this book  use objects for a project manager application, which are enhanced  chapter by chapter.)
 By following the prescription outlined here,  VB developers can create scalable objects that support transactions  (with MTS), data binding (with OLE DB and ADO), and even message-based  event delivery across multiple servers on the enterprise (with  MSMQ). The author also shows how the same objects can be used with  ASPs on the Web. Clearly, the CSLA has a lot of potential for building  objects that scale well and meet the needs of today''s enterprise.
Professional Visual Basic 6 Distributed Objects is written in a  no-nonsense style, with short paragraphs and practical examples used  throughout. The author''s experience with design for VB  enterprise-level lets him show that today''s Visual Basic is ready to  take on the enterprise on the Microsoft platform. For enterprise  development, both on and off the Web, this guide makes a strong pitch  for a spot on the bookshelf of anyone serious about VB  development. --Richard DraganProduct Description
Visual Basic is the leading Windows development tool with  3-4 million licenses sold.    
Many VB developers face the challenge of building scalable  applications using distributed COM objects in Visual Basic 6. There  are many books which describe n-tier architecture and also  object-oriented programming, but this book is about merging the best  capabilities of the Object-Oriented (OO) approach with your system  architecture. It does this with Rocky Lhotka''s ''distributed object''  technique.

Inside COM+ Base Services examines many aspects of Microsoft''s Component Object Model+ in depth. The book provides a great deal of information well-suited to experienced C++ programmers, as well as thorough explanations and useful code examples.
 As with most books from Microsoft Press, this volume comes with a well-organized CD-ROM that contains complete source code for the examples presented in the book. (Most of the examples are actually code fragments, but the CD-ROM contains the code in its entirety.) One very nice feature of the CD-ROM is that it includes the contents of the book in Microsoft Electronic Book format, which makes searching for passages and copying code fragments very easy. Not limited to the C++ audience only, the book presents COM+ implementations in Visual Basic and J++ too.
 It should be mentioned that this book targets a lot of information at those who know C++ and have some background with the Windows API (and preferably some with OLE or COM.) For those with only a Visual Basic background or who want an overview, this book is probably too C++-specific. Also keep in mind that this book is an update of Inside Distributed COM. Several topics that are new to COM+, such as message queuing and transactions, are not covered in this book (the next book in the series, Inside COM+ Component Services, due out in spring 2000, might cover these topics). 
 Overall, if you are a C++ programmer, are using the Windows API, and are interested in learning about DCOM and COM+, this book provides clear explanations, useful programs and code fragments, and a lot of detailed examples. --John Keogh
Topics covered: Introduction to component software; interfaces; CLSIDs; GUIDs; registering components; templates; interfaces; references and reference counting; v-tables; implementing COM+ with Java and Visual Basic; type libraries; threads and apartments; automation; errors, exceptions, and error handling; connection points; type information; persistence and structured storage; naming and monikers; DLL surrogates; location transparency; DCOM; standard and custom marshalling; executable components and in-process components; interprocess communication; Interface Definition Language; asynchronous calls; COM+ security, including the COM+ security model, platform-independent security, and configuring security; cloaking; COM+ networking; remote activation; object references; and RPCs.

Product Description

Although Microsoft''s Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM)  is one of the most widely used component standards in the computing  industry, it has a well-deserved reputation for being rather difficult  to master. While many tools (such as Visual Basic) let programmers use  DCOM without understanding how it works, C++ and Java programmers who  need to know more will want to turn to Inside Distributed  COM. This surprisingly readable reference mixes enough technical  detail with actual source code drawn from C++, Java, and Visual Basic  to show how DCOM really works. 
 The authors start out simply,  identifying the basics of COM running on a local machine, and run  through the essentials of what COM objects are and how they promote  reuse. They present the basic interfaces of COM and discuss the  philosophy of COM''s object design regarding containment and  aggregation. (Although COM does not support inheritance, it can  simulate such relationships in other ways.) 
 After laying the  theoretical groundwork, the book features several excellent  nuts-and-bolts chapters that demonstrate how COM works in several  programming languages: C++ (including the Active Template Library),  Java (which hides many of the details of COM programming), and Visual  Basic (which makes using COM transparent to programmers). The short  examples drawn from each language show how COM is an essential part of  the Microsoft programming languages and tools.
 The book moves into  more of the technical aspects of COM, such as automation (for  scripting COM components), connection points (for event handling),  monikers (for identifying COM components regardless of their location  on the network), and marshaling (which lets objects send data between  objects). The authors mix in a useful amount of theory while  consistently holding the reader''s interest. A chapter on threading  models (a difficult topic) is also particularly clear, and the authors  even provide their "ten commandments" for threading  models--rules that show when to use single or multiple threading  apartments.
 Later chapters discuss distributed computing and the  problems that need to be solved as COM moves to distributed  systems. These chapters include the advantages to in-process servers  versus stand-alone processes in distributed architectures and a full  discussion of the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (IDL), which  allows components to talk to one another.
 The book closes with new  technologies, including how developers can benefit from using  Microsoft Transaction Server for robust transaction management and how  the emerging COM+ standard will add even more to the mix, with  services that rival CORBA for enterprise-wide distributed  computing. Inside Distributed COM may be the best guide to  understanding COM, whether you are running it on a single machine or  multiple machines. The authors succeed in highlighting what you should  understand about this important technology in order to become a more  effective developer or information services manager.

A lot of corporate databases are what''s behind the Internet revolution.   Professional SQL Server 2000 DTS gives DBAs and programmers a handy guide   to getting the most out of the Data Transformation Services (DTS)--a flexible   set of tools that work on a wide variety of databases--that are available in SQL   Server 2000.
    The hands-on focus of the book makes it a win for readers of all backgrounds.   While online help for DTS is not always easy to decipher, this book remedies the   situation with plenty of screen shots of all of the major tools in action. Early   sections examine nearly two dozen built-in tasks or functions in DTS--from the   obvious (copying data from one database to another) to the more esoteric   (sending files via FTP within DTS).
    A gentle introduction to using VBScript and ActiveX objects gets at the DTS   object model to design "custom tasks." By using this approach, you can automate   and transform data reliably among different formats, including mainframe and   Office documents. (Specific tips guide you in working with DB2 and Excel data.)   A standout section looks at "linking" servers and querying data from   heterogeneous sources.
    You also learn how to build a Web front end (using ASPs) for a data application   that uses SQL-DMO APIs to automate database tasks through a browser. Later,   there''s an excellent tutorial on data warehousing, done the Microsoft way--from   the basics of the star, snowflake, and hybrid fact tables for a data mart to   setting up and loading the data using DTS, and then running the database with   Microsoft Analysis Services. The book closes with a thorough reference section   that lists the objects and methods in the DTS object model.

</h3>A lot of corporate databases are what''s behind the Internet revolution.   <I>Professional SQL Server 2000 DTS</I> gives DBAs and programmers a handy guide   to getting the most out of the Data Transformation Services (DTS)--a flexible   set of tools that work on a wide variety of databases--that are available in SQL   Server 2000.<p>    The hands-on focus of the book makes it a win for readers of all backgrounds.   While online help for DTS is not always easy to decipher, this book remedies the   situation with plenty of screen shots of all of the major tools in action. Early   sections examine nearly two dozen built-in tasks or functions in DTS--from the   obvious (copying data from one database to another) to the more esoteric   (sending files via FTP within DTS).<p>    A gentle introduction to using VBScript and ActiveX objects gets at the DTS   object model to design "custom tasks." By using this approach, you can automate   and transform data reliably among different formats, including mainframe and   Office documents. (Specific tips guide you in working with DB2 and Excel data.)   A standout section looks at "linking" servers and querying data from   heterogeneous sources.<p>    You also learn how to build a Web front end (using ASPs) for a data application   that uses SQL-DMO APIs to automate database tasks through a browser. Later,   there''s an excellent tutorial on data warehousing, done the Microsoft way--from   the basics of the star, snowflake, and hybrid fact tables for a data mart to   setting up and loading the data using DTS, and then running the database with   Microsoft Analysis Services. The book closes with a thorough reference section   that lists the objects and methods in the DTS object model.<p>    Whether you''re performing normal database administration or setting up a data   warehouse--or you just want to work with data more effectively within your   applications--<I>Professional SQL Server 2000 DTS</I> gives you all of the   information that you need to be productive with a powerful (and sometimes   overlooked) set of database tools and components. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>    <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to Data Transformation Services   (DTS) <li>Survey of DTS wizards and tools <li>The Import/Export Wizard <li>The   Copy Database Wizard <li>The DTS Designer <li>Survey of automated tasks in SQL   Server 2000, including the Bulk Insert, Execute SQL, Copy SQL Server Objects,   and Transfer Databases tasks <li>The Multiphase Data Pump <li>Using a Data   Driven Query (DDQ) <li>The FTP Task <li>The Execute Package Task <li>The Message   Queue Task <li>Advanced package options <li>General package properties   <li>Transfer Data Task options <li>Data scrubbing <li>Working with heterogeneous   data (using linked servers from mainframe and legacy servers) <li>Tips for   converting Excel and DB2 data <li>DTS ActiveX Script basics <li>Quick tutorial   for VBScript syntax <li>The DTS Object Model <li>File management with the   <I>FileSystemObject</I> object <li>DTS security issues <li>Meta Data Services   <li>Backing up databases <li>DTS error handling <li>Building custom tasks in DTS   <li>Star, snowflake, and hybrid designs for data warehouses <li>Extract,   Transformation, and Load (ETL) with DTS <li>Microsoft Analysis Services   <li>Creating Web front ends for DTS applications <li>Reference to the DTS and   ADO object models <li>Reference to essential VB functions and keywords   <li>Microsoft Scripting Run-Time Reference</ul>

CBT INSIDE SQL 2000 SVR

Amazon.com Review
To help you design Microsoft database servers that must achieve the best possible performance, Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2000 has the details you need. For one thing, author Kalen Delaney (who used Ron Soukup''s fantastic first edition as a starting point) explains how SQL Server 2000 works at a level that will interest all database administrators. She packs in the sort of minutiae that can make a real difference in the performance of especially large or complex data-storage structures, explaining what goes on inside the database management system (DBMS) when it''s presented with various commands, and using that information to back up her abundant advice on the right way to design, build, and operate databases under SQL Server 2000.
    Delaney makes extensive use of DBCC PAGE dumps to show what''s going on in the databases that demonstrate concepts (incidentally, that utility is documented, as well as the others in the DBCC toolbox). In a typical section, DBCC PAGE is used to show how index pages work. There''s careful attention to database structure at the byte level too, with conceptual diagrams that explain how pointers work and how strings of strings of bytes combine to represent stored data. It''s the sort of detail you need if you''ll be writing software for SQL Server 2000, or need to extract maximum performance from the DBMS itself. --David Wall
Topics covered: Microsoft SQL Server 2000 internals, especially data structures and the behavior of queries. Table design is emphasized, especially indexing decisions. Transact-SQL programming, including the use of cursors, gets lots of attention.

For anyone who works with databases on the Microsoft platform,  ADO 2.1 Programmer''s Reference provides a thorough guide to the  latest Microsoft APIs in a small handbook that fits into any size  briefcase. This book will be appreciated for its efficient packaging  of late-breaking technical information, as well as many small samples  that show how to use these APIs effectively.
 The best thing about  this guide is its concise format explaining all major APIs used for  database programming on the Microsoft platform. There''s excellent  coverage of Active Data Object (ADO) basics (with whole chapters that  look at its Connection, Command, and Recordset objects). The book also  pays attention to programming on the client with RDS programming for  Internet Explorer. Standout sections include an excellent explanation  of data-shaping principles, along with a worthwhile programming  how-to. Samples are presented using Visual Basic, with tips on using  these objects in C++, Visual J++, and today''s scripting languages.
  Tutorial sections show off how to work with these APIs, and reference  sections list every method and constant for quick lookup. With its  handy size and thorough scope, ADO 2.1 Programmer''s Reference  is suitable for Visual Basic, Web scripting, Java, and C++  programmers--in other words, any developer who works with databases  using Microsoft tools. --Richard Dragan
Topics  covered: ADO object model and APIs, OLE DB, ADOX (for programming  with tables, fields, indexes, etc.), RDS, data warehousing and ADO  Multidimensional (ADOMD), Jet and Replication Options (JRO), data  shaping and Internet publishing, performance, tutorial, and API  reference.

Product Description
  ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) is the core technology for accessing all kinds of data including relational databases, mail servers, text and other document files, and data in other non-standard formats. It is supplied with many development environments, including Microsoft''s Visual C++, Visual Basic and Visual J++, and as part of the Windows NT operating system; and is also available for free from http://www.microsoft.com. It is also commonly used by ASP developers, but is supported by all COM-compliant languages.   This book is a guide and reference to using ADO for your data access. We explain the structure of the ADO 2.1 object model. We cover usage of the entire object model, with extra information and examples that focus on the most commonly-used aspects of the objects. The book also contains chapters on remote access using RDS, new technologies ADOX (ADO Extensions for DDL and Security), ADOMD (ADO Multi-Dimensional) and JRO (Jet Replication Objects), and a guide to performance issues.

Further, the book defines a core agile subset&emdash;so those of you who want to "get agile" need not spend years learning to do it.

Microsoft are promoting their Distributed interNet Architecture (DNA) as a platform for developing fully distributed applications, but it has taken a while to get the DNA message across. The difficulty was in trying to push DNA as a solution in itself, rather that pushing the ideas that make it good, i.e.:n-tier client/server applications~Client transparency~Distributed applications~Fully transactional~Fault tolerant~The core of DNA is the use of business objects in a middle tier of the application, and this is supported by two new technologies: Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS), which is a component manager offering full transaction support; and Microsoft Message Queue Server (MSMQ), which provides the fault-tolerance required in distributed application. Together, these make it simple to build into the DNA dream.

Samba, the Server Message Block (SMB) server software that makes it relatively easy to integrate Unix or Linux servers into networks of Microsoft Windows workstations, has to date been mostly explained as an afterthought. Most often, it''s appeared in the latter chapters of books about Linux. It deserves better, and the authors of Using Samba have delivered exactly that.
 This book documents Samba 2.0.4 fully (version 2.0.5, source and binary, appears on the companion CD-ROM), focusing on smbd, nmbd, the command-line tools, and Samba''s newfound ability to integrate itself securely with Windows NT domains. 
 Though it includes a bit of information on the SMB and Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocols that underlie Samba, the emphasis here is on setting up and configuring software. Explicit sections explain how to install Samba on a Unix/Linux system and how to set up Microsoft clients to communicate with the Samba machine. The authors pay lavish attention to the Samba configuration file, smb.conf, and explain exactly what settings you need to include in it to allow disk shares, network browsing, and integration with Windows domains. A highly useful reference that lists all Samba configuration options (along with their valid values, default values, and explanations) appears in an appendix. --David Wall
Topics covered: All aspects of setting up and configuring Samba 2.0 and its variants, including client configuration, file sharing, network browsing, file system differences between Windows and Unix/Linux, security, and the contents of the Samba configuration file.

Product Description
Using Samba, Second Edition is a comprehensive guide to Samba administration. This new edition covers all versions of Samba from 2.0 to 2.2, including selected features from an alpha version of 3.0, as well as the SWAT graphical configuration tool. Updated for Windows 2000, ME, and XP, the book also explores Samba''s new role as a primary domain controller and domain member server, its support for the use of Windows NT/2000/XP authentication and filesystem security on the host Unix system, and accessing shared files and printers from Unix clients.  In Using Samba, you''ll begin with an introduction to Windows networking concepts that will help you quickly understand how it works, how it is similar to Unix networking, and how it differs.  The first chapters will guide you through the process of installing Samba, configuring Windows clients, and implementing a Windows domain. Subsequent chapters show you how to configure additional services and fine-tune the operation of the Samba server. Anyone who manages a network that has both Unix (including Mac OS X) and Windows systems will want to read this book.

</h3><i>Using Samba</i>, Second Edition is a comprehensive guide to Samba administration. This new edition covers all versions of Samba from 2.0 to 2.2, including selected features from an alpha version of 3.0, as well as the SWAT graphical configuration tool. Updated for Windows 2000, ME, and XP, the book also explores Samba''s new role as a primary domain controller and domain member server, its support for the use of Windows NT/2000/XP authentication and filesystem security on the host Unix system, and accessing shared files and printers from Unix clients.  In <i>Using Samba</i>, you''ll begin with an introduction to Windows networking concepts that will help you quickly understand how it works, how it is similar to Unix networking, and how it differs.  The first chapters will guide you through the process of installing Samba, configuring Windows clients, and implementing a Windows domain. Subsequent chapters show you how to configure additional services and fine-tune the operation of the Samba server. Anyone who manages a network that has both Unix (including Mac OS X) and Windows systems will want to read this book.

Without Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), network   administrators might have to actually get out of their chairs and go   see what''s up with all of the network-connected equipment under their   authority. Perish the thought. Essential SNMP explains how the   management protocol works and how it''s implemented by several operating   systems and pieces of equipment. More importantly, this book shows its   reader--who should be a network administrator who''s familiar with the   problems of running a distributed network--how SNMP can earn its place   as a network administration tool. In other words, this book examines   SNMP as a strategic resource as well as a technical   phenomenon.
Because it''s oriented toward SNMP as a tool, much of the   coverage in this book has to do with software that uses SNMP to provide   network monitoring and control services. After a   strengths-and-weaknesses overview of a number of SNMP packages, the   authors use mainly HP OpenView, Castle Rock SNMPc, and Net-SNMP (the   last in combination with Perl scripting) to demonstrate how SNMP works   and how to take advantage of it. It''s the scripting that really   distinguishes this book from other SNMP books, by the way. It''s   integral to the authors'' presentation, and the latter half of this book   is packed with shell and Perl listings. --David Wall
Topics covered: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and   its applicability as a network management tool. Details like object   identifiers (OIDs), management information bases (MIBs), traps, and   community strings are defined and explained. The configuration of SNMP   agents is detailed for several software packages and operating systems,   and the integration of SNMP and scripts (in shell languages and in   Perl) is covered nicely.

Product Description
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is an Internet-standard protocol for managing hosts on an IP network. Essential SNMP is a practical introduction to SNMP for system administrators. It starts with the basics: what SNMP is and how it works, along with some technical background to help administrators use it effectively--such things as how SNMP works and what OIDs, MIBs, community strings, and traps are. But the main focus of the book is on practical network administration: how to configure SNMP agents and network management stations, how to use SNMP to retrieve and modify variables on network devices, how to configure management software to react to traps sent by managed devices.  Essential SNMP discusses a range of commercial and open source packages, including HP''s OpenView, Castle Rock''s SNMPc, the Net-SNMP tools, Simon Leinen''s Perl SNMP support, and MRTG. The book covers all SNMP versions through SNMPv3.

Aimed at the experienced C++ programmer, Herb Sutter''s Exceptional C++ tests the reader''s knowledge of advanced C++ language features and idioms with several dozen programming puzzles and explanations. This book can definitely help raise your C++ class design skills to the next level.
 Based on the author''s Guru of the Week Web column, this book poses a series of challenging questions on the inner workings of C++, centering around generic programming with the Standard Template Library (STL), exception handling, memory management, and class design. Even if you think you know C++ well, most of these problems will teach you something more about the language and how to write more robust classes that are "exception safe" (meaning they don''t throw any handled exceptions or leak resources). Don''t think this is just "language lawyering," though. The author''s explanations stress sound programming principles (favoring simplicity) and idioms (such as the Pimpl idiom for class design that promotes faster compile times and better maintainability, or using "smart" auto_ptrs with STL.) Judging from the range and depth of these examples, Sutter''s command of the inner workings of C++ is impressive, and he does an excellent job of conveying this expertise without jargon or a lot of theory. 
 After reading this book, C++ designers will learn several "best practices" of how to write robust, efficient classes that are "exception safe." Chances are you''ll gain a better understanding of memory management techniques and working with STL too. For the experienced developer seeking leading-edge knowledge of some of the best ways to use C++, Exceptional C++ is both a challenging and truly worthwhile source of information. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Advanced C++ programming tutorial, generic programming, tips for string classes, containers and STL, temporary objects, exception-safe code tutorial, virtual functions, class inheritance, the Pimpl idiom, namespaces, memory management, C++ memory areas, overloading new and delete, using smart pointer with auto_ptr, using const, casts, and hints for better performance and code maintainability.

Two of the most powerful, albeit complex, technologies  available to the Visual C++ programmer are ActiveX and COM. This book  is a tool for the professional developer and gets down and dirty on  topics such as interoperability, remote execution, and ActiveX control  development.
 This work moves at a fast pace, illustrating  techniques and discussing underlying technology. It dives into the  details of the Component Object Model (COM) and how to write an  ActiveX control from scratch or with the ActiveX Template  Library. Next, the book lays out the construction of an ActiveX  calendar control and tells how to make it work with legacy  architectures using DCOM. The text then goes into a detailed  discussion of DCOM, security, and ActiveX integration with  intranets. Appendix A presents a nice architectural discussion of  real-world business use of the Internet and closed intranets.
 While  this book focuses on a very specific type of C++ programming, it  covers some of the least understood yet very enabling technologies in  depth. If you consider yourself a strong C++ programmer and want to  leverage ActiveX and COM to create sophisticated enterprise  applications, you''ll find this reference very useful.

If you consider yourself a strong C++ programmer and want to  leverage ActiveX and COM to create sophisticated enterprise  applications, you''ll find this reference very useful.

In this brand-new third edition of The C++ Programming  Language, author Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++, presents  the full specification for the C++ language and standard library, a  spec that will soon become the joint ISO/ANSI C++ standard.
 Past  readers will find that the new edition has changed a great deal and  grown considerably to encompass new language features, particularly  run-time type identification, namespaces, and the standard library. At  the same time, readers will recognize the lucid style and sensible  advice that made previous editions so readable and enjoyable. Probably  the biggest change is a substantial new section, well over 200 pages  in length, covering the contents and design of the C++ standard  library, the most important new feature of the C++ specification. The  author has also added a substantial number of new exercises while  keeping many from previous editions that have retained their value.
  While The C++ Programming Language is not a C++ tutorial,  strictly speaking, anyone learning the language, especially those  coming from C, will greatly benefit from the clear presentation of all  its elements. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this  book for anyone who is serious about using C++.

Product Description
More than 500,000 programmers have benefited from previous   editions! This is a complete rewrite of the most widely read and most   trusted book on C++. Based on the ANSI/ISO C++ final draft, this book   covers the C++ language, its standard library, and key design   techniques as an integrated whole. The C++ Programming Language   provides comprehensive coverage of C++ language features and standard   library components. For example, it includes complete coverage of   abstract classes as interfaces, class hierarchies for object-oriented   programming, templates as the basis for type-safe generic software,   exceptions for regular error handling, namespaces for modularity in   large-scale software, run-time type identification for loosely coupled   systems,  the C subset of C++ for C compatibility and system-level   work, standard containers and algorithms, and standard strings, I/O   streams, and numerics. With this third edition, Stroustrup makes C++   even more accessible to those new to the language while adding   information and techniques that even expert C++ programmers will find   invaluable.

Programming Microsoft Visual C++ reveals the structures  and systems that make Windows programs work. If you know C well and  are at all familiar with C++, this latest version of a classic text is  an excellent springboard into programming for Microsoft Windows.
  This book is sure to reveal new information to those with Windows  programming experience--most of which has to do with the new tools  available to Windows programmers. The authors explain COM and Active  Template Library (ATL). In learning about those things, you absorb  information about ActiveX technologies, database programming, and  Microsoft''s Internet facilities. Additionally, this guide is still the  best around for those who want to put well-behaved windows on the  screen, fill them with controls, and have them perform useful  functions. Illumination of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) has  traditionally been this book''s strong point, and the coverage of MFC 6  in this edition upholds the tradition.
 Throughout, illustrative  code translates well to real-world projects (particularly since it all  appears on a companion CD-ROM). Each example tackles a particular  task, such as how to use a persistent frame window class or how to  refer to the contents of Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs). --David  WallProduct Description

For most users, e-mail is just another application on their  computers. For developers, however, Internet e-mail involves a  dizzying array of standards and formats. Programming Internet  Email takes all of today''s e-mail standards and puts them together  in a readable form.
 David Wood has compiled his knowledge of a  broad array of topics to create this fine guide for both developers  and the technologically curious. He explains what makes Internet  e-mail work and then dives into the Multipurpose Internet Mail  Extensions (MIME), Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions  (S/MIME), Open Pretty Good Protocol (OpenPGP), and Post Office  Protocol 3 (POP3) standards. Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP),  Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP), and vCard--the e-mail version  of business cards--are also covered. 
 For each topic, the book  simply explains its purpose and then presents its command usage with  code examples. This discussion will be understood best by programmers,  but the opening introductions easily reach those with more general  expertise.
 Beyond the basics, Wood presents the Java Mail API,  antispamming techniques, attachment scrubbing, and Java-based IMAP  mailbox monitoring. 
While this book is a simple collection of  separate technology discussions, it offers universal information on  e-mail. Illustrative and filled with facts, this book will help you  design your own e-mail client--or simply understand how one  works. --Stephen W. PlainProduct Description

Patterns are basically design solutions for recurring problems, so Core J2EE Patterns contains recurring design solutions for persons using J2EE. The authors break these solutions down into presentation, business, and integration patterns.
    As is usual with pattern books, you won''t find much code here. The book majors on problem discussions, analysis of the factors you should consider in your design, and strategies for the solution implementation. The authors constantly encourage abstraction, code modularity, non-duplication of code, network efficiency, code maintainability, and solution reusability.
    While these are the aims we''ve been encouraged to pursue for years, too many pattern books operate at such a high theoretical level they fail to appeal to working programmers. In practice, you could use the patterns discussed with any language, but by concentrating on using Java, Core J2EE Patterns is able to take a more hands-on approach.
    Okay, so you won''t find detail at the level of APIs, but you will find discussion of where to implement functionality to best leverage Java''s architecture and which Java mechanisms to use: for example, implementing entity beans as coarse-grained--rather than fine-grained--objects to reduce the transaction overhead. Not the sort of implementation advice you''ll find in language-agnostic pattern books.
Core J2EE Patterns enables you to dramatically cut the design time on enterprise-level Java-based projects while increasing the likelihood that the project will reach a timely fruition. Recommended. --Steve Patient, Amazon.co.ukProduct Description
Sun Microsystems'' Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) has become the platform of choice for Web-centric distributed enterprise application development. Expert consultants from the Sun Java Center have been helping customers build J2EE-based solutions since the earliest days of the technology, focusing primarily on up-front design and architecture. Along the way, they''ve identified powerful J2EE design patterns that lead to applications with superior performance, scalability, and robustness. This book brings those design patterns together, sharing Sun''s best practices for development with Java Server Pages (JSP), Servlets, EJB, and other J2EE technologies. It presents a complete catalog of J2EE patterns encapsulating proven and recommended designs for common J2EE-related problems, organized into presentation tier, business tier and integration tier solutions. Presentation tier patterns describe solutions involving JSP and servlets; business tier patterns describe solutions involving EJB; and integration tier patterns describe solutions involving JDBC and Java Messaging Service (JMS). The book also identifies bad practices to be avoided.  Finally, it presents an end-to-end multi-tier case study covering every stage of enterprise development.

Learning how to write multithreaded applications is the key to taking full advantage of the Java platform. In Taming Java Threads, well-known columnist and Java expert Allen Holub provides Java programmers with the information they need to write real multithreaded programs&emdash;programs with real code. Holub provides an in-depth explanation of how threads work along with information about how to solve common problems such as deadlocks and race conditions. He not only explains common problems, but also provides the uncommon solutions that mark the difference between production-level code and toy demos.

Topics covered in this book include the architecture of threads; the mutex and lock management; condition variables and counting semaphores; timers, alarms, and swing thread safety; observers and multicasters; singletons, critical sessions, and reader/writer locks; threads in an object-oriented world; and object-oriented threading architectures.

While it is essential to build support for threading into a Java program from the very beginning, most books on the subjects of Java-UI construction and Java networking barely touch on threading topics.

Advanced Java Networking, Second Edition--an excellent introduction to sockets, RMI, IDL/CORBA, JDBC, and other APIs--surveys all the ways to create state-of-the-art server-side solutions with Java. If you''re a developer or architect, this book can help you build scalable Internet solutions.
Advanced Java is notable in at least two ways. First and foremost, it presents each Java networking API with real intelligence and enthusiasm. The authors of the second edition (who have revised the book thoroughly) prove they have considerable teaching experience by including plenty of interesting examples. The same application (for a simple appointment-scheduling program) is used throughout the text. You learn how to use sockets, RMI, IDL/CORBA, and even servlets and JSPs to build different versions of the same application. This comparative approach gives you a sense of the strengths of each API. (A final chapter here outlines when to use each API, depending on your design needs.)
    Besides hands-on coding examples, several chapters present a high-level introduction to new Java APIs like JINI, naming services, and JNDI, plus EJBs and network management with JMAP. Generally, this book strikes a good balance between explaining the underlying technology behind each Java API, and providing basic sample code to help get you started. While you certainly don''t need to use every networking API for every project, this title introduces them all so that you can choose the best approach. The new edition of Advanced Java Networking packages an excellent mix of sample code and technological expertise--of value in choosing the best options for networking on today''s Java platform. --Richard Dragan

This groundbreaking book is the first in the Kimball Toolkit series to be product-specific. Microsoft’s BI toolset has undergone significant changes in the SQL Server 2005 development cycle. SQL Server 2005 is the first viable, full-functioned data warehouse and business intelligence platform to be offered at a price that will make data warehousing and business intelligence available to a broad set of organizations. This book is meant to offer practical techniques to guide those organizations through the myriad of challenges to true success as measured by contribution to business value.    
    Building a data warehousing and business intelligence system is a complex business and engineering effort. While there are significant technical challenges to overcome in successfully deploying a data warehouse, the authors find that the most common reason for data warehouse project failure is insufficient focus on the business users and business problems. In an effort to help people gain success, this book takes the proven Business Dimensional Lifecycle approach first described in best selling The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit and applies it to the Microsoft SQL Server 2005 tool set.    
    Beginning with a thorough description of how to gather business requirements, the book then works through the details of creating the target dimensional model, setting up the data warehouse infrastructure, creating the relational atomic database, creating the analysis services databases, designing and building the standard report set, implementing security, dealing with metadata, managing ongoing maintenance and growing the DW/BI system. All of these steps tie back to the business requirements. Each chapter describes the practical steps in the context of the SQL Server 2005 platform.    
Intended Audience
    The target audience for this book is the IT department or service provider (consultant) who is:      Planning a small to mid-range data warehouse project;       Evaluating or planning to use Microsoft technologies as the primary or exclusive data warehouse server technology;       Familiar with the general concepts of data warehousing and business intelligence. 
    The book will be directed primarily at the project leader and the warehouse developers, although everyone involved with a data warehouse project will find the book useful. Some of the book’s content will be more technical than the typical project leader will need; other chapters and sections will focus on business issues that are interesting to a database administrator or programmer as guiding information.    
    The book is focused on the mass market, where the volume of data in a single application or data mart is less than 500 GB of raw data. While the book does discuss issues around handling larger warehouses in the Microsoft environment, it is not exclusively, or even primarily, concerned with the unusual challenges of extremely large datasets.

The second edition of the JDBC API Tutorial and  Reference provides a worthwhile tour of the new features in Java  Database Connectivity (JDBC) 2.0 and serves well as a reference to  Sun''s new standard for Java database programming.
 Once you open  this book, it becomes quickly obvious that it is more comprehensive  than the first edition. The new edition begins with an overview of the  JDBC API, including its architecture and overall design. Beginners  will also be pleased with a short breakdown of the Java programming  language and SQL basics.
 Early sections of the book walk through an  approachable tutorial of JDBC, concentrating on topics such as  connecting to databases, retrieving result sets, manipulating records,  and handling database transactions. There''s also coverage of using  stored procedures, including embedded SQL with SQLJ.
 The book then  turns to new JDBC 2.0 API features, like scrollable cursors,  updateable record sets, and batch updates. Experienced readers will  appreciate how the authors show off JDBC 1.0 code before presenting  these new features. An explanation of SQL3 data types supported in  JDBC 2.0 follow the discussion of the API features.
 The book  provides extensive support for finding and understanding recordsets  and databases, including the use of the oddly named  ResultSetMetaData and DatabaseMetaData classes, which  have been greatly enhanced in JDBC 2.0. (You can now write Java code  that customizes itself at runtime for almost any SQL platform.)   Similar in spirit to the Microsoft OLE DB, the new JDBC 2.0 now  supports rowsets, which let programmers work with any tabular  data store from within their applications. 
 Most of the book (over  600 pages) functions as a reference containing every JDBC 2.0  class. Presented alphabetically, each class comes with an introductory  definition and a complete listing of its constituent members and  methods (including deprecated APIs). Final sections include a guide to  "SQL to Java" mappings and tips for writing JDBC drivers.
 Whether  you are approaching JDBC for the very first time or are ramping up  from JDBC 1.0, there is perhaps no better source for learning about  the enhanced powers of the new JDBC than this "official" guide from  Sun. --Richard DraganProduct Description
This book provides the definitive description of the JDBC(tm) API, the technology that enables universal data access for the Java(tm) programming language. This new edition has been updated and expanded to cover all of the JDBC 2.0 API, including the JDBC 2.0 core API and the JDBC Standard Extension API, the package that facilitates building server-side applications.    
Containing in-depth explanations that go beyond the specification, this complete resource pairs a step-by-step tutorial with a comprehensive reference to all of the classes and interfaces.    
For those new to Java technology, the book includes an introduction to the Java programming language and to SQL. It builds on this basic knowledge to walk you through creating a JDBC application-from setting up a database and establishing a connection to retrieving values from result sets and using prepared statements. In addition, the authors provide many examples along the way that demonstrate how to execute common tasks. The book proceeds to more advanced topics, focusing on the new features of the JDBC 2.0 API, including scrollable and updatable result sets, batch updates, SQL3 data types, custom mapping, and more.    
You will also find an introduction to working with the JDBC  metadata API as well as information on rowsets, the technology that  makes it possible to handle data sets from virtually any data source  as JavaBeans(tm) components.    
From array to XADataSource, a useful alphabetical reference provides concise but complete information on each class and interface in the JDBC API. Each entry includes an overview as well as a list and explanation of the methods and fields.    
A chapter on mapping SQL types and types in the Java programming language, a summary of the new JDBC 2.0 features, and a glossary complete this indispensable resource for all database programmers.

Springthe open source Java-based frameworkallows you to build lighter, better performing applications. Written by Spring insiders Rob Harrop and Jan Machacek, Pro Spring is the only book endorsed by Rod Johnson, founder of the Spring Framework. At over 800 pages, this is by far the most comprehensive book available and thoroughly explores the power of Spring. You''ll learn Spring basics and core topics, as well as share the authors'' insights and real-world experience with remoting, mail integration, hibernate, and EJB.    
From the Foreword: "Robs enthusiasm for Springand technology in generalis infectious. He has a wide range of industry experience and a refreshingly practical, common sense approach to applying it. All those qualities come out in this book. Its evident on nearly every page that it reflects in-depth experience with Spring and J2EE as a whole. Rob is not only an author and open source developerhe is an application developer, like his readers. I firmly believe that the best writing on software development comes out of experience in the trenches, so this is my kind of book.    
If youre new to Spring, this book will help you understand its core concepts and the background in areas such as transaction management and O/R mapping that underpins them. If youre already using Spring, you will learn about features you havent yet seen and hopefully, gain a deeper understanding of those features youre already using."  Rod Johnson, Founder of the Spring Framework.

The most important part of the Java 2 (JDK 1.2) standard is  its Swing user interface classes. Pure JFC Swing is a  well-organized guide to all the new Swing components, and it includes  clear programming examples. Besides a worthy overview of Swing  development, this book provides over 300 pages of reference material  on all Swing objects, properties, and methods.
 The book begins with  a guide to what''s new in Swing, including its new interface components  and pluggable look and feel. It continues with instructions on how to  use Swing alongside traditional Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)  components. Clear examples, along with short commentary by the author,  are the norm in Pure JFC Swing.
 Next the book provides a  blow-by-blow tour of Swing classes, from getting started with panels  to events and basic and advanced Swing components. His explanation of  Swing''s Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture is particularly  noteworthy, as are the examples for using such sophisticated Swing  controls as JTable (for grids) and JTree (for tree controls). From  simple to complex components, the author''s code examples are just what  you need to start using Swing effectively on your own.
 The second  half of the book contains a reference to all Swing objects and events,  organized by package. (An extensive index lets you search easily for  whatever topic you need.)
 Though occasionally a little dry, this  title is perfect for the intermediate or advanced JDK 1.1 developer  who wants to master the latest in Swing functionality  quickly. --Richard DraganProduct Description
  Pure JFC  is a substantial and focused reference for sophisticated Java programmers. This book begins with an accelerated introduction to JFC so that experienced Java programmers can quickly understand the new concepts and begin developing their own JFC applications.

Two hot topics come together in this developer''s guide from Brett   McLaughlin, Java and XML. Both Java and XML are cross-platform   technologies; by using Java for code and XML for transporting data, you can   build truly portable applications. This title is aimed at intermediate to   advanced programmers; while XML topics are explained more or less from scratch,   readers will need prior knowledge of Java.
    The book begins with an overview of XML and its uses, and goes on to explain how   to parse XML by using the Simple API for XML (SAX 2). Next, there is coverage of   how XML is validated by using Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and XML Schema,   and transformed by using eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Brief coverage of   Sun''s Java API for XML is followed by a detailed look at the Java Document   Object Model (JDOM), a new API devised by the author in association with   O''Reilly, the publisher. 
    The last part of the book is more advanced, and covers applications of XML and   Java. There are chapters on Web-publishing frameworks, XML Remote Procedure   Calls (RPCs), using XML to read and write configuration data, and generating XML   with Java. There is also a short business-to-business example. Appendices   provide an API reference to the various specifications discussed in the book.
    The strengths of Java and XML include the author''s deep knowledge of his   subject, and a writing style that is both clear and enthusiastic. If you happen   to know a lot about Java and not much about XML, this is the ideal title.   Readers who already have a good grasp of XML basics might be frustrated by the   amount of introductory material. --Tim AndersonProduct Description
Java and XML share many features that are ideal for building web-based  enterprise applications, such as platform-independence, extensibility,  reusability, and global language (Unicode) support, and both are based on  industry standards. Together Java and XML allow enterprises to simplify  and lower costs of information sharing and data exchange. Java and XML shows  how to put the two together, building real-world applications in which  both the code and the data are truly portable.

Mark Grand''s Patterns in Java, Volume 2 offers a grab  bag of 50 reusable patterns for Java developers. Together, these  patterns can improve your graphical user interface (GUI) design,  testing, and the overall robustness of your next Java project.
  After a short introduction to patterns and UML (unified modeling  language) basics, the author looks at the software engineering life  cycle, then moves on to describe the first group of object-oriented  design patterns, including Creator, Polymorphism, and Law of  Demeter.
 Less theoretical, the next group of GUI patterns can let  you create more responsive and intuitive interfaces. (Experienced  programmers will already know several of these, such as the Form  pattern for dialog boxes and the Disabled Irrelevant Things pattern,  which grays out unused items.) The following sections on  organizational coding and coding optimization patterns are the most  practical as they offer ways to write better Java code, including  conditional compilation, exception handling, and socket  programming.
 Next, the author includes a group of code robustness  patterns, including assertions. The book closes with more theoretical  material on testing. (Patterns such as White/Black Box or Regression  Testing will be familiar turf to anyone who knows a little software  engineering.)
 A good many of the patterns cataloged here probably  call attention to the obvious. (For instance, is using a Java  switch statement really a true "pattern," as the authors  argue?) But with a total of 50 patterns, this guide provides a helpful  group of reusable strategies. Many of these patterns will be  absolutely essential to any working Java developer. --Richard  DraganProduct Description
Patterns have emerged as one of the most significant new fields in object-oriented technology. Patterns can be code, rules, methods, problems or solutions that keep recurring in a software project. The appeal of patterns is that experienced programmers can share them, or nuggets of lessons learned, with other programmers to help save enormous amounts of product development time and money. Following on from the first volume, this book covers newer types of patterns written in Java such as - GRASP, Presentation or GUI, Coding, and Testing. The books work together, yet can also be read independently. The author uses UML to diagram each pattern. Other important topics include: coverage of UML and how it fits in with the analysis, implementation, and testing phases of a life cycle; case studies that demonstrate how to use these patterns in the real world; covers where NOT to use patterns; use of presentation or GUI patterns with Java Foundation Classes (JFC/Swing); over 45 different patterns presented with real-world examples and code; and a CD-ROM gives all Patterns code used in book plus J Whiteboard Edition Rational Rose ''98.

JavaScript is a powerful way to extend HTML content and work  with Java applets, but developing with this language can be  tricky. With this one-volume reference, you can begin using scripts  within Web pages and also learn some of JavaScript''s high-end  features.
Early sections treat JavaScript as just another  programming language, detailing data types, operators, and basic  keywords. Then the book turns to the nuts and bolts of script  development inside Web pages, featuring advanced topics you might not  find elsewhere, such as the possibility of running JavaScript scripts  on the server.
Further chapters explain how to get to browser  objects from JavaScript, describing windows, forms, and event  handling. There is also a good introduction to manipulating Java  applets and Netscape plug-ins (such as Shockwave) with JavaScript. But  some of the best chapters teach you how to use browser cookies within  Java and offer debugging tips from the author. (JavaScript is  legendarily difficult to debug, and the author has a number of  potentially helpful suggestions here.)
Final sections show  JavaScript at work with dynamic HTML. The reference material at the  end of Instant JavaScript gives a handy listing of JavaScript  fundamentals and HTML tags, making this book useful as both a tutorial  and a place where JavaScript developers can get answers.

With full coverage of the three latest Sun Java certification  exams, Java 2 Certification Training Guide provides an  excellent resource for any Java programmer prepping for these  tests.
 The best thing about this book is its insider-track  perspective on three Sun exams. This book concentrates on the  Programmer exam (which comprises well over half the book) but also  addresses the Architect and Developer tests.  Since the author has  worked with Sun to help develop the actual exams, he is a worthy guide  to the material here. And as the author himself points out, even if  you are a great Java programmer, passing these exams isn''t easy  because they include details--and sometime obscure features--that you  don''t use every day.
 Even if you are an experienced Java developer,  you will appreciate the author''s thorough tour of Java language  fundamentals, core classes, and packages. Even the book''s numerous  tables present Java information efficiently. 
 Rather than a general  guide to Java programming, the presentation is geared closely to what  you''ll need for these certification tests. Another standout feature  here are the review questions, which follow Sun''s format and style as  well as the inclusion of a sample computer-based exam on CD-ROM.
  For readers seeking a higher level of Java certification, the book  provides everything you will need for the Architect and Developer  exams too. Besides a review of Java APIs like JDBC and Remote Method  Invocation (RMI), you will find material on the basics of distributed  systems, including short sections on CORBA and DCOM. For Developer  certification, the book lists dos and don''ts for writing  successful code on the exam.
 With its mix of expert guidance and  challenging sample test questions, Java 2 Certification Training  Guide makes for an effective guide to getting certified on today''s  Java 2 platform. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered:  test preparation for the Sun Certified Programmer, Architect, and  Developer Exams; Java language fundamentals; core packages; threads;  AWT; event handling; graphics; I/O; Java object-oriented and  distributed architectures; security; JDBC; and RMI.

Product Description
  One of the best ways for a Java programmer to stand out from the crowd is to become a Sun Certified Java Programmer, Developer, or Architect. This book helps Java developers prepare for all three certification exams. One of the strengths of this book is that it is extremely focused--it doesn''t contain extraneous information, a history of Java, or background on related technologies. This book gives readers exactly what they need to pass the exams. This book also contains a uniques test engine (written in Java by the author) to help readers assess their skills and become confident with the structure of the exams.

Even the book''s numerous  tables present Java information efficiently. <p> Rather than a general  guide to Java programming, the presentation is geared closely to what  you''ll need for these certification tests. Another standout feature  here are the review questions, which follow Sun''s format and style as  well as the inclusion of a sample computer-based exam on CD-ROM.<p>  For readers seeking a higher level of Java certification, the book  provides everything you will need for the Architect and Developer  exams too. Besides a review of Java APIs like JDBC and Remote Method  Invocation (RMI), you will find material on the basics of distributed  systems, including short sections on CORBA and DCOM. For Developer  certification, the book lists <I>dos</I> and <I>don''ts</I> for writing  successful code on the exam.<p> With its mix of expert guidance and  challenging sample test questions, <I>Java 2 Certification Training  Guide</I> makes for an effective guide to getting certified on today''s  Java 2 platform. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>:  test preparation for the Sun Certified Programmer, Architect, and  Developer Exams; Java language fundamentals; core packages; threads;  AWT; event handling; graphics; I/O; Java object-oriented and  distributed architectures; security; JDBC; and RMI.

What is this book about?
XSLT 2.0 Programmer''s Reference, 3rd Edition, is the authoritative reference guide to the language. Without using the formal and inaccessible language of the W3C specifications, it tells you exactly what every construct in the language does, and how it is intended to be used. This book is a reference rather than a tutorial; it is designed for the professional programmer who is using the language every day. It is the book that people quote when they claim that a particular product is giving the wrong answer, and the book that implementers of the language turn to when they want clarification of the specifications.  
 At the same time, the book is readable. Reviews of the previous editions of the XSLT Programmer’s Reference, which this book grew from, show that readers appreciate the background material on the design thinking behind the language, the essay on functional programming, the occasional dry wit, the gentle criticism of the language specification when appropriate, and the fact that the examples stray into a diverse range of interesting application areas.

There are open-source firewalls, and there are commercial firewalls that are easier to configure. No software firewall, however, has the reputation for impermeability that Check Point FireWall-1 NG has. Essential Check Point FireWall-1 NG exists to serve the network administrator as a manual and ready reference for the defensive utility. It''s a sensitive role, because a poorly administered firewall can be worse than no firewall at all. Dameon Welch-Abernathy provides his readers with the knowledge they need--in the form of both instructions and raw information--to install, set up, and administer FireWall-1 NG properly in a variety of configurations. 
    A word of warning: This book provides detailed installation instructions for Microsoft Windows 2000 only. Though other supported operating systems get some coverage, only for Windows does the author walk you through the complete set of installation screens. This may or may not be a problem for you. With installation out of the way, the book treats configuration in an approximately platform-neutral fashion (though all screen shots are from Windows 2000). Typically, Welch-Abernathy opens a section with some theoretical information (about authentication, say, or firewalling in VPNs), then provides a relevant stepped procedure for a typical scenario, then goes through a very useful series of questions and answers (which are indexed separately--a helpful feature). It''s a good approach that helps guarantee the reader gets the required information. --David Wall
Topics covered: How to knowledgeably and effectively support Check Point FireWall-1 NG. In addition to basic firewall functionality and rule-setting, the author covers Virtual Private Network (VPN) setups, alternative forms of user authentication, Network Address Translation (NAT), and reliability issues. Special chapters cover the INSPECT and SecuRemote/SecureClient utilities.

Programming Active Server Pages is not just a tutorial  for creating dynamic Web pages, but also a guide to all the relevant  tools and necessary Microsoft technology required to build  state-of-the-art Web sites. Stressing a hands-on approach and  featuring plenty of relevant screen shots, the authors take you  through the basics of HTML and scripting languages such as VBScript,  ActiveX, and Java and explain how Active Server Pages (ASPs) can be  used to deliver platform-independent dynamic content. Further sections  introduce Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), Personal Web  Server as a development tool, and Open Database Connectivity (ODBC)  basics for connecting to databases. The authors then turn to the  fundamentals of working with Internet Explorer 4, as well as its  version of dynamic HTML, where all tags can be manipulated  programmatically. Finally, the authors look at how ASPs can be used on  IIS to deliver content dynamically.
 Further chapters show off ASPs  in action in a sample online bookstore application, which includes  processing orders, an online catalog, and a magazine. (The  accompanying CD-ROM includes full source code.) Other chapters tackle  e-mail systems using Microsoft and Transaction Server, which can  provide reliable transaction processing and better scalability for Web  sites. As the authors note here, no developer can afford to  concentrate on only a single programming language or tool. This book  does a fine job of providing all you need to get started linking  technologies and tools in the Microsoft line of products for  successful Internet development.

Patterns are higher-order designs that can be reused across  projects and types of computer systems. Analysis Patterns: Reusable  Object Models defines over 70 patterns, beginning with some from  the business world, such as the Party and Accountability patterns,  which define the players in organizations and whom they report  to. Many of the other patterns are drawn from the health care industry  and mainly show patterns of doctor-patient interactions.
 The  patterns for financial markets will probably be accessible for the  majority of readers. Author Martin Fowler defines a Transaction  pattern (and related patterns) as well as several patterns for the  Accounting of Objects. He moves on to modeling stock markets with  Portfolio, Quote, and Scenario patterns, which define how a price for  a stock is determined for a given moment. Interestingly, he  establishes patterns for Forward Contracts (for derivatives) as well  as Options, and so takes on a complicated area in today''s financial  markets.
 Fowler''s considerable design experience in these fields is  beneficial, as he is able to define each pattern in both text and  software engineering diagrams. Only rarely does the author provide  implementations of these designs and those that are furnished are done  in Smalltalk, which makes this book more suitable for those who have  experience in object design.

Written for the advanced C++ developer, Learning DCOM  looks beyond wizard-generated code to teach you how you to build most  of the C++ code yourself in order to create effective distributed  Component Object Model (DCOM) components.
 The book commences with a  tour of distributed computing, from the early days of terminal  emulation, to the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) and onward to today''s  DCOM. The author includes a rich introduction to COM, from objects and  built-in and custom interfaces to important concepts such as  containment and aggregation. Though somewhat densely written, these  chapters on the details of DCOM expose its real inner workings with  standout material providing a full treatment of the different thread  apartment models.
 The second half of the book focuses on existing  wizard-based code (using Visual C++ tools for the Active Template  Library [ATL] and Microsoft Foundation Classes [MFC] COM components)  starting with an ATL server-side optical character recognition (OCR)  component. The author then presents client-side programming strategies  for COM, far beyond tapping built-in Visual C++ capabilities, that  incorporate custom template-based smart pointers for calling COM  objects.
 The book then turns to Web development where an OCR  example is used within an Internet Explorer Web page. Sections on  security demonstrate how to cooperate with Windows NT, as well as  auditing and administrative options. Unfortunately, coverage of  Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) is omitted here, arguably one of  the most critical aspects of writing scalable Web applications. A  final chapter on event handling (and connection points) shows off how  to process events with distributed components. 
 Notable for its  considerable technical depth and detail, Learning DCOM gives  the advanced developer the inside track on creating state-of-the-art  DCOM components. --Richard DraganProduct Description
DCOM is a rich and robust method for creating expandable and flexible components, allowing you to plug in new parts conveniently and upgrade without the need for code changes to every program that uses your component.  This book introduces C++ programmers to DCOM and gives them the basic tools they need to write secure, maintainable programs. While using Visual C++ development tools and wizards where appropriate, the author never leaves the results up to magic. The C++ code needed to create distributed components and the communications exchanged  between systems and objects are described at a level where the reader understands their significance and can use the insights for such tasks as debugging and improving performance.  After giving you a grounding in how DCOM works, this book introduces you  to the Microsoft tools that make it all easy. Topics include MIDL, error handling, dispatch and dual interfaces, standard and custom factories, management of in-process versus out-of-process servers, standard and custom marshaling, and writing a component that can be invoked from Visual Basic. You''ll also learn about multithreading and apartments, security at the system configuration and programming level, Active Template Library (ATL) and ATL wizards, embedding a control in a Web client, and more.

Creating effective install programs is all too often an  afterthought in many software projects. This book shows how easy it is  to take advantage of the features of InstallShield (the leading  installation toolkit from InstallShield Software). The first part of  Bulletproof Installs looks at the powerful capabilities of  InstallShield 5.1. (A demo of the product is included in the  accompanying CD-ROM.) InstallShield can automate every aspect of even  complex installations, including "add-on" Microsoft technologies such  as DirectX (for games), Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), ActiveX  Data Object (ADO), Remote Data Objects (RDO), and object linking and  embedding database (OLE-DB). The author shows you how to use the  built-in wizards to create basic--and powerful--install programs.
  The book goes further, too, with full coverage of InstallShield''s very  powerful InstallScript programming script language, which supports  extensive data types and flow-control statements and several hundred  APIs. Other valuable chapters look at operating system issues for  installation (and uninstallation), such as the Windows 95 and NT 4  System Registry conventions and other conventions of a "correct"  install. The book closes with a how-to on extending and customizing  installation scripts. --Richard DraganProduct Description

The Extreme Programming (XP) paradigm has developers doing things like   programming in pairs, writing tests to verify all code, and continuously   refactoring designs for improved performance. Written by two of its inventors,   Planning Extreme Programming shows you how to implement XP by using a   simple, effective process. This remarkably short (yet remarkably useful) title   will give any XP manager or programmer a perspective on delivering software that   meets the needs of customers better.
    Simplicity is the watchword of the XP software process. This book is virtually   devoid of traditional software-engineering jargon and design diagrams, and yet   does a good job of laying the foundation of how to perform XP--which is all   about working with a customer to deliver features incrementally.
    The terminology in the book is commonsensical. (In the terms of XP, each   iteration adds certain new features, or stories. It''s up to the customer to   decide what functionality is more important and will be delivered first. By   never letting a working build get out of sight, the XP process virtually ensures   that software will be close to what the customer wants.)
    Early chapters borrow analogies from everyday experience--like planning a trip   or driving a car--to set the stage for XP process planning. The book has plenty   of advice for dealing with the stakeholders (customers) of a project. Because of   confidentiality agreements, however, we don''t get many details from the real   world, although the discussion is anchored by a hypothetical project for   planning the Web site of the future for travel, with some specifics.
    There is plenty of advice for planning projects, based on individual and team   "velocity" (a measure of productivity) and the like--practical suggestions for   running daily, short status meetings (in which all of the participants stand up,   to keep them short). Clearly, there''s a culture that surrounds many XP teams,   and this text does a good job of conveying some of this to the reader.
    At fewer than 150 pages, Planning Extreme Programming is notably concise,   and that''s probably the whole point. Most shops today work on Internet time,   which doesn''t wait for extensive project analysis and design documents. In XP,   you create working software from the very start. This book is an essential guide   to anyone who''s working in XP shops or who might be interested in what this   innovative, iterative software process can offer. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered:Introduction to planning Risk management in   software "Driving" as a metaphor for software development Roles for   software development: business vs. technical people Four variables for   project planning: cost, quality, time, and scope Predicting future   programmer productivity, based on past performance Project scope and   estimation The XP process: software releases, iterations, stories,   collecting, and writing stories (features) Hints for ordering features   Tips on planning and status meetings Using visual graphs to monitor   project progress Tracking and fixing bugs Project red flagsProduct Description
Focuses on the time and cost for developing each user story and determining its priority, and planning software releases accordingly.

This readable,  comprehensive guide shows how well-managed software teams can produce  better, more profitable software in less time. 
 The book begins by  outlining the "traditional" waterfall approach to software  development. The author looks at what changes for management when it  comes to today''s iterative software processes. Written with an eye  toward management (with plenty of tables and figures for project  estimation and planning), the author takes you through common pitfalls  of managing software. 
 Besides reviewing older studies and metrics,  the author offers his own 10 principles to managing software, along  with hints for all facets of development, from initial inception to  construction and deployment of software. The author provides detailed  project milestones and other deliverables to help you manage software  better, including a breakdown of tasks for your team that will help  maximize your efficiency.
 After a look forward at what better  software management means for return on investment (ROI), the author  presents several very useful appendices, which include software  metrics (like COCOMO), as well as a description of the CCPDS-R missile  command system (which used many of the author''s management  principles). Overall, this groundbreaking title will be useful to any  software manager or project leader seeking to get control of software  costs and improve team efficiency. --Richard DraganProduct Description

Dont Park Your Brain Outside is a book filled with  anecdotes, helpful hints, the latest methods, and even cartoons!    
Dont Park Your Brain Outside is the thinking persons guide to  extraordinary project performance with "SMART"  management. Francis Hartman has assembled a cohesive and balanced  approach to highly effective project management. It is deceptively  simple. Called SMART, this new approach is Strategically Managed,  Aligned, Regenerative, and Transitional. It is based on research and  best practices, tempered by hard-won experience. SMART has saved  significant time and money on the hundreds of large and small, simple  and complex projects on which it has been tested.    
This book takes a different approach to project management, making it  more accessible to the many people who manage or participate in  projects. It offers an approach to project management that deals with  many of the real day-to-day concerns of the practitioner in delivering  difficult and volatile projects.

</h3>Dont Park Your Brain Outside is a book filled with  anecdotes, helpful hints, the latest methods, and even cartoons!    <P>Dont Park Your Brain Outside is the thinking persons guide to  extraordinary project performance with "SMART"  management. Francis Hartman has assembled a cohesive and balanced  approach to highly effective project management. It is deceptively  simple. Called SMART, this new approach is Strategically Managed,  Aligned, Regenerative, and Transitional. It is based on research and  best practices, tempered by hard-won experience. SMART has saved  significant time and money on the hundreds of large and small, simple  and complex projects on which it has been tested.    <P>This book takes a different approach to project management, making it  more accessible to the many people who manage or participate in  projects. It offers an approach to project management that deals with  many of the real day-to-day concerns of the practitioner in delivering  difficult and volatile projects. It brings together the processes and  techniques that many exceptional managers use and that researchers are  trying to understand the balance of hard tools and people skills  that lead to highly successful projects.

Written for analysts who have at least some previous  experience with data warehousing, Microsoft OLAP Solutions  provides a working guide to analyzing legacy data with the new  Microsoft online analytical processing (OLAP) Services. This book  assumes you understand the fundamentals of what data warehousing is  and how it works; if you do, this guide masterfully presents the  strengths (and limitations) of OLAP technology.
 Database (DB)  analysts know that Microsoft OLAP is the proverbial new kid on the  block when it comes to data warehousing. It offers good wizards and  tools to simplify creation and maintenance of a data warehouse. While  the authors of Microsoft OLAP Solutions dutifully explain some  of the technical terminology related to OLAP (like cubes and  dimensions) and design, many readers will likely seize on the chapters  that examine actually using OLAP wizards and tools for building  warehouses. Moreover, the reference to MDX (OLAP''s data-analysis  language) will be invaluable here. 
 This book presents some  warehousing theory first, and then it focuses on specifics, including  two excellent case studies (for analyzing databases for health care  and a grocery store) at the end of the book. It also offers chapters  on implementing changes and optimizing OLAP databases once they are up  and running.
 There''s little doubt that with the weight of Microsoft  behind it, OLAP will be a reasonable option for many corporate data  warehouses. This book gives you all the information you need to apply  your data warehouse knowledge to this new Microsoft  platform. --Richard Dragan
Topics covered: Microsoft  OLAP, datahouse warehousing design, dimensions and cubes, pure OLAP  (MOLAP), relational OLAP (ROLAP), hybrid OLAP (HOLAP),  Multidimensional Expressions (MDX), maintenance, and optimization.

Product Description
The authors merge their deep experience in OLAP to produce a roadmap to success with Microsoft SQL Server OLAP Services.--Bill Baker, Microsoft Corporation.  Microsoft OLAP Solutions  OLAP enables users to create, change, and access information from multi-dimensional data warehouses almost instantaneously. Microsoft has unleashed the power of OLAP in one of its most popular products, SQL Server 7, now distributed with its OLAP Services component. This guide to mastering Microsoft OLAP Services begins with a practical introduction to OLAP server concepts and architecture. It then progresses by logical, skill-building steps through a range of crucial topics in maintenance, database optimization, and advanced database design. The authors include in-depth case studies illustrating how to build OLAP applications, as well as instructions on how to construct working OLAP applications, including a healthcare benefits analysis application and a grocery store frequent shopper analysis application.  Topics covered in detail include: * The storage and operational architecture of Microsoft OLAP server. * Using the MDX language with Microsoft OLAP server. * Using Microsoft OLAP server to access and update data. * Specifying calculations. * Optimizing server performance. * Securing the server.  On the CD-ROM you''ll find: * All the sample applications and databases described in the book. * Additional software for working with Microsoft OLAP server.

For a family whose members use computers every day, there are few easier ways to increase fun and productivity than with a small local area network (LAN). With a LAN in place, you can use any computer in the house to run your finance software and access your electronic mail. A LAN also makes it easy for the whole family to share an Internet connection, particularly a fast cable or xDSL one. This Wired Home: The Microsoft Guide to Home Networking is the gospel of home LANs according to Microsoft. It provides excellent instruction on designing, assembling, and configuring a home LAN that involves computers running Windows 98 or Windows NT 4. With its explicit statements of what to buy and what to do, you''ll be happy with Alan Neibauer''s work (unless you own a Macintosh).
 Thankfully, Neibauer doesn''t assume that a full-fledged LAN is the correct solution for everyone. He explains how to share a printer simply, using only a couple of extra cables and a switch box. But the real value in this book is in its clear explanations of installing network interface cards (NICs), setting up hubs, running cable, and configuring the software properly. Illustrations combine high-quality drawings (for hardware assembly sections) with screen shots (for sections on software setup). Even when explaining the complicated matters associated with sharing an Internet connection, Neibauer sticks to his clear, businesslike style. --David Wall
Topics covered: Advantages of a home network, alternatives to a full local area network (LAN), installing network interface cards (NICs), running cable, configuring Windows computers for LAN service, sharing an Internet connection, and performing specific tasks (printing, file sharing, and game playing) on the network.

Charles Petzold''s latest book, Code: The Hidden Language of  Computer Hardware and Software, crosses over into general-interest  nonfiction from his usual programming genre. It''s a carefully written,  carefully researched gem that will appeal to anyone who wants to  understand computer technology at its essence. Readers learn about  number systems (decimal, octal, binary, and all that) through  Petzold''s patient (and frequently entertaining) prose and then  discover the logical systems that are used to process them. There''s  loads of historical information too. From Louis Braille''s development  of his eponymous raised-dot code to Intel Corporation''s release of its  early microprocessors, Petzold presents stories of people trying to  communicate with (and by means of) mechanical and electrical  devices. It''s a fascinating progression of technologies, and Petzold  presents a clear statement of how they fit together. 
 The real  value of Code is in its explanation of technologies that have  been obscured for years behind fancy user interfaces and programming  environments, which, in the name of rapid application development,  insulate the programmer from the machine. In a section on machine  language, Petzold dissects the instruction sets of the genre-defining  Intel 8080 and Motorola 6800 processors. He walks the reader through  the process of performing various operations with each chip,  explaining which opcodes poke which values into which registers along  the way. Petzold knows that the hidden language of computers exhibits  real beauty. In Code, he helps readers appreciate  it. --David Wall
Topics covered: Mechanical and  electrical representations of words and numbers, number systems, logic  gates, performing mathematical operations with logic gates,  microprocessors, machine code, memory and programming languages.

Product Description
From the dots and dashes of Morse code to the 0s and 1s of computer programming, "Code" describes the ingenious ways humans have adapted language systems -- code -- to invent the machinery of the modern age. By examining the dialogues we developed for and through the communication tools of the industrial revolution, readers discover they have a context for comprehending today''s world of computers, bar code scanners, and fiber optics. The work of legendary computer book author Charles Petzold has influenced an entire generation of programmers -- and with "Code", Microsoft Press is proud to bring this extraordinary writer''s compelling narrative style and wit to a general audience.

MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit (Exam 70-293): Planning and - Maintaining Windows Server 2003 Network Infrastructure - self-training course - CD, English

Amazon.com Review
In the certification craze of 1999-2001, tens of thousands of people earned their Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE) ratings. Those certifications are expiring now, just as Microsoft is coming out with Windows Server 2003 to replace the Windows 2000 family of operating systems. There may be a real opportunity for those who earn the Windows Server 2003 certification--and that''s where MCSE Self-Paced Training Kit: Microsoft Windows Server 2003 Core Requirements comes in. This four-book set (which comes with quiz software and a 180-day laboratory version of Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition, plus a coupon for 15 percent off the cost of each of the four exams), combined with some hands-on practical work, should be all you need to earn the new MCSE rating or the Microsoft Certified System Administrator (MCSA) certification.
    Each of the four books (each with a separate author) covers the published requirements of a single exam. Coverage tends to be text-heavy--even procedures rely mostly on text and use few screen shots. This goes to reinforce the fact that these are serious books for people with a pretty good idea of what they''re doing already. Chapters typically begin with conceptual coverage of their subjects (using diagrams to illustrate the relationships among network entities in many cases) and move on to illustrative procedures to try. Chapters then conclude with carefully considered discussion questions. The answers to the questions appear in an appendix, complete with explanations of why the correct answers are what they are. --David Wall

The first edition of this book was released at the 2001 Tech Ed conference in Atlanta, Georgia. Since that time, this text has been revised, tweaked, and enhanced to account for the changes found within each release of the .NET platform (1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and now 3.5).  
The last version, .NET 3.0, was more of an augmentative release, essentially providing three new APIs: Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) and Windows Workflow Foundation (WF). As you would expect, coverage of the "W''s" has been expanded a great deal in this version of the book from the previous Special Edition text.  
Unlike .NET 3.0, .NET 3.5 provides dozens of new C# language features and .NET APIs. This edition of the book will walk you through all of this new material using the same readable approach as was found in previous editions. Rest assured, you''ll find detailed coverage of Language Integrated Query (LINQ), the C# 2008 language changes (automatic properties, extension methods, anonymous types, etc.) and the numerous bells and whistles of Visual Studio 2008.  What you will learn  Everything you need to know - get up to speed with C# 2008 quickly and efficiently.Discover all the new .NET 3.5 features -- Language Integrated Query, anonymous types, extension methods, automatic properties, and more.Get a professional foothold -- targeted to appeal to experienced software professionals, this book gives you the facts you need the way you need to see them.A rock-solid foundation - focuses on everything you need to be a successful .NET 3.5 programmer, not just the new features. Get comfortable with all the core aspects of the platform -- including assemblies, remoting, Windows Forms, Web Forms, ADO.NET, XML web services, and much more.  Who is this book for?  
If you''re checking out this book for the first time, understand that it targets experienced software professionals and/or students of computer science (so please don''t expect three chapters devoted to "for" loops). The mission of this text is to provide you with a rock-solid foundation to the C# 2008 programming language and the core aspects of the .NET platform (OOP, assemblies, file IO, Windows Forms/WPF, ASP.NET, ADO.NET, WCF,WF, etc.). Once you digest the information presented in these 33 chapters, you''ll be in a perfect position to apply this knowledge to your specific programming assignments, and you''ll be well equipped to explore the .NET universe on your own terms.

Using the story/parable format so popular these days, Leadership and Self-Deception takes a novel psychological approach to leadership. It''s not what you do that matters, say the authors (presumably plural--the book is credited to the esteemed Arbinger Institute), but why you do it. Latching onto the latest leadership trend won''t make people follow you if your motives are selfish--people can smell a rat, even one that says it''s trying to empower them. The tricky thing is, we don''t know that our motivation is flawed. We deceive ourselves in subtle ways into thinking that we''re doing the right thing for the right reason. We really do know what the right thing to do is, but this constant self-justification becomes such an ingrained habit that it''s hard to break free of it--it''s as though we''re trapped in a box, the authors say. 
 Learning how the process of self-deception works--and how to avoid it and stay in touch with our innate sense of what''s right--is at the heart of the book. We follow Tom, an old-school, by-the-book kind of guy who is a newly hired executive at Zagrum Corporation, as two senior executives show him the many ways he''s "in the box," how that limits him as a leader in ways he''s not aware of, and of course how to get out. This is as much a book about personal transformation as it is about leadership per se. The authors use examples from the characters'' private as well as professional lives to show how self-deception skews our view of ourselves and the world and ruins our interactions with people, despite what we sincerely believe are our best intentions. 
 While the writing won''t make John Updike lose any sleep, the story entertainingly does the job of pulling the reader in and making a potentially abstruse argument quite enjoyable. The authors have a much better ear for dialogue than is typical of the genre (the book is largely dialogue), although a certain didactic tone creeps in now and then. But ultimately it''s a hopeful, even inspiring read that flows along nicely and conveys a message that more than a few managers need to hear. --Pat McGill', N'<h3 class="review">From Amazon.com

When programming teams buy into TDD, they immediately see positive results. They eliminate the fear involved in their jobs, and are better equipped to tackle the difficult challenges that face them. TDD eliminates tentative traits, it teaches programmers to communicate, and it encourages team members to seek out criticism However, even the author admits that grumpiness must be worked out individually! In short, the premise behind TDD is that code should be continually tested and refactored.

Alistair Cockburn''s Writing Effective Use Cases is an   approachable, informative, and very intelligent treatment of an essential topic   of software design. "Use cases" describe how "actors" interact with computer   systems and are essential to software-modeling requirements. For anyone who   designs software, this title offers some real insight into writing use cases   that are clear and correct and lead to better and less costly software.
    The focus of this text is on use cases that are written, as opposed to   modeled in UML. This book may change your mind about the advantages of writing   step-by-step descriptions of the way users (or actors) interact with systems.   Besides being an exceptionally clear writer, the author has plenty to say about   what works and what doesn''t when it comes to creating use cases. There are   several standout bits of expertise on display here, including excellent   techniques for finding the right "scope" for use cases. (The book uses a color   scheme in which blue indicates a sea-level use case that''s just right, while   higher-level use cases are white, and overly detailed ones are indigo. Cockburn   also provides notational symbols to document these levels of detail within a   design.)
    This book contains numerous tips on the writing style for use cases and plenty   of practical advice for managing projects that require a large number of use   cases. One particular strength lies in the numerous actual use cases (many with   impressive detail) that are borrowed from real-world projects, and demonstrate   both good and bad practices. Even though the author expresses a preference for   the format of use cases, he presents a variety of styles, including UML   graphical versions. The explanation of how use cases fit into the rest of the   software engineering process is especially good. The book concludes with several   dozen concrete tips for writing better use cases.
    Software engineering books often get bogged down in theory. Not so in Writing   Effective Use Cases, a slender volume with a practical focus, a concise   presentation style, and something truly valuable to say. This book will benefit   most anyone who designs software for a living. --Richard Dragan

</h3>Alistair Cockburn''s <I>Writing Effective Use Cases</I> is an   approachable, informative, and very intelligent treatment of an essential topic   of software design. "Use cases" describe how "actors" interact with computer   systems and are essential to software-modeling requirements. For anyone who   designs software, this title offers some real insight into writing use cases   that are clear and correct and lead to better and less costly software.<p>    The focus of this text is on use cases that are <I>written</I>, as opposed to   modeled in UML.

Agile and iterative methods have emerged as the most popular approaches to software development, and with good reason. Research (examined and cited in detail within this book) shows that iterative methods reduce the risk of failure, compared to traditional models of development. This book is an efficient introduction for both managers and practitioners that need a distilled and carefully organized learning aid for the hands-on practices from planning to requirements to testing and the values that define these methods. The author also provides evidence of the value of switching to agile and iterative methods. By studying this book, the reader will learn to apply the key ideas in agile and iterative development, the details and comparison of four influential iterative methods (Scrum, Extreme Programming, Evo, and the Unified Process), answers to frequently asked questions, and important related management skills. The book''s goal is quality information that can be quickly understood and applied.

Best practices for managing projects in agile environments — 
now updated with new techniques for larger projects

Today, the pace of project management moves faster. Project management needs tobecome more flexible, and far more responsive to customers. Using Agile Project Management (APM), project managers can achieve all these goals without compromising cost, quality, or business discipline. In Agile Project Management, Second Edition, renowned Agile pioneer Jim Highsmith thoroughly updates his classic guide to APM, extending and refining it to support even the largest projects and organizations. 

Writing for project leaders, managers, and executives at all levels, Highsmith integrates the best project management, manufacturing, and software development practices into an overall framework designed to support unprecedented speed and mobility. The many topics added in this new edition include incorporating agile values, scaling agile projects, release planning, portfolio governance, and enhancing organizational agility. Project and business leaders will especially appreciate Highsmith’s new coverage of promoting agility through performance measurements based on value, quality, and constraints. 

This edition’s coverage includes: 

·    Understanding the Agile revolution’s impact on product development
·    Recognizing when Agile methods will work in project management, and when they won’t
·    Setting realistic business objectives for Agile Project Management
·    Promoting Agile values and principles across the organization
·    Utilizing a proven Agile Enterprise Framework that encompasses governance, project and iteration management, and technical practices
·    Optimizing all five stages of the Agile project: Envision, Speculate, Explore, Adapt, and Close
·    Organizational and product-related processes for scaling Agile to the largest projects and teams
·    Agile project governance solutions for executives and management 
·    The “Agile Triangle”: measuring performance in ways that encourage agility instead of discouraging it
·    The changing role of the Agile project leader', N'<h3 class="review">Product Description

Thinking in Java is a printed version of Bruce Eckel''s online materials that provides a useful perspective on mastering Java for those with previous programming experience. The author''s take on the essence of Java as a new programming language and the thorough introduction to Java''s features make this a worthwhile tutorial.
Thinking in Java begins a little esoterically, with the author''s reflections on why Java is new and better. (This book''s choice of font for chapter headings is remarkably hard on the eyes.) The author outlines his thoughts on why Java will make you a better programmer, without all the complexity. The book is better when he presents actual language features. There''s a tutorial to basic Java types, keywords, and operators. The guide includes extensive source code that is sometimes daunting (as with the author''s sample code for all the Java operators in one listing.) As such, this text will be most useful for the experienced developer.
 The text then moves on to class design issues, when to use inheritance and composition, and related topics of information hiding and polymorphism. (The treatment of inner classes and scoping will likely seem a bit overdone for most readers.) The chapter on Java collection classes for both Java Developer''s Kit (JDK) 1.1 and the new classes, such as sets, lists, and maps, are much better. There''s material in this chapter that you are unlikely to find anywhere else.
 Chapters on exception handling and programming with type information are also worthwhile, as are the chapters on the new Swing interface classes and network programming. Although it adopts somewhat of a mixed-bag approach, Thinking in Java contains some excellent material for the object-oriented developer who wants to see what all the fuss is about with Java.

Are you a print designer working on the Web? An HTML coder learning about server-side hosting for the first time? Web Design in a Nutshell has slim but whole chapters for those topics-- and everything else you can imagine.
 Written in the popular "Nutshell" format, this guide is full of helpful tables and lists, making it a perfect desktop reference. The book breaks down the huge topic of Web site development into understandable, readable segments: the Web environment (browsers, displays, design principles), an in-depth guide to HTML tags, graphics manipulation and display, multimedia possibilities, and technologies for larger site management (such as Cascading Style Sheets [CSS] and XML).
 While this book is certainly comprehensive, the abundance of information could be overwhelming to someone just starting out with HTML. In addition, the heart of this book is filled with technical specificity on Web page creation (for example, a section under "Graphics" is titled "GIF87a versus GIF89a"). Readers looking for more conceptual explanations of Web design and layout would be better served with other titles. But for day-to-day development and maintenance, Web Design in a Nutshell is a truly well-constructed toolkit.

The Practical SQL Handbook explains Structured Query Language (SQL) simply, without being condescending and deeply without being obscure. From its early chapters about relational database theory to its superb coverage of transaction management, this book is informative and easy to follow. 
 The authors begin by explaining how to design efficient data structures, an important part of database management. From there, they discuss how to populate a database with pieces of data and then explain how to construct queries that extract needed information. Throughout, the text is filled with statements, code and output--and even common SQL errors. You ought to be able to follow along on any ANSI SQL 92-compliant system as you read this book.
 Later chapters cover reports, joins, views, subqueries and security. The authors explain each from a practical point of view, as demonstrated by a section on common database tasks (how to specify decimal precision, for example). A good glossary exists in the back of this book, and a comprehensive table documents the differences among Sybase, Microsoft, Informix and Oracle SQL command sets. The companion CD-ROM contains the Sybase SQL Anywhere Studio software, which ordinarily requires a 15-MB download marathon. --David Wall', N'<h3 class="review">From Amazon.co.uk

For any developer who wants to do more with XML and databases on Windows, Programming Microsoft SQL Server 2000 with XML provides an up-to-date guide to some current XML tools and features available on the Microsoft platform. This example-packed book can let you get more productive with the latest generation of SQL Server tools.
After a quick tour of what XML means for business today, this text jumps right in with a tutorial on using XML in Microsoft Transact-SQL (T-SQL) supported in SQL Server. The author provides nuts-and-bolts information on querying databases and returning XML, along with different options for formatting XML data. 
Next comes a tutorial for using ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), the preferred standard for programming with databases in Windows, and how to use XML within this API. Short code excerpts will show you how to perform common programming tasks quickly. The support for XML in Microsoft doesn''t stop there, of course, and the book next focuses in on support for Web publishing in SQL Server through XML. This powerful feature shows you how to define templates that can be used to query and update data via HTTP using URLs. Sections on mapping schemas show how XML can used to move data between different database schemas. An important section on the T-SQL OpenXML function to perform a range of database tasks, including inserting XML data in bulk into database tables. 
In its closing sections, this text illustrates key technologies using a nicely functional online computer store complete with shopping basket, product catalogue, and simulated order processing all using XML techniques demonstrated earlier on.
In all, this book delivers a solid tour of what''s available in SQL Server, ADO, and other Microsoft tools and technologies. Suitable for any Windows IT professional who works with databases, this title is a capable tutorial and guide to what''s out there today with XML on the Microsoft platform. --Richard Dragan', N'<h3 class="review">From Amazon.co.uk

Billy Beane, general manager of MLB''s Oakland A''s and protagonist of Michael Lewis''s Moneyball, had a problem: how to win in the Major Leagues with a budget that''s smaller than that of nearly every other team. Conventional wisdom long held that big name, highly athletic hitters and young pitchers with rocket arms were the ticket to success. But Beane and his staff, buoyed by massive amounts of carefully interpreted statistical data, believed that wins could be had by more affordable methods such as hitters with high on-base percentage and pitchers who get lots of ground outs. Given this information and a tight budget, Beane defied tradition and his own scouting department to build winning teams of young affordable players and inexpensive castoff veterans. 
  Lewis was in the room with the A''s top management as they spent the summer of 2002 adding and subtracting players and he provides outstanding play-by-play. In the June player draft, Beane acquired nearly every prospect he coveted (few of whom were coveted by other teams) and at the July trading deadline he engaged in a tense battle of nerves to acquire a lefty reliever. Besides being one of the most insider accounts ever written about baseball, Moneyball is populated with fascinating characters. We meet Jeremy Brown, an overweight college catcher who most teams project to be a 15th round draft pick (Beane takes him in the first). Sidearm pitcher Chad Bradford is plucked from the White Sox triple-A club to be a key set-up man and catcher Scott Hatteberg is rebuilt as a first baseman. But the most interesting character is Beane himself. A speedy athletic can''t-miss prospect who somehow missed, Beane reinvents himself as a front-office guru, relying on players completely unlike, say, Billy Beane. Lewis, one of the top nonfiction writers of his era (Liar''s Poker, The New New Thing), offers highly accessible explanations of baseball stats and his roadmap of Beane''s economic approach makes Moneyball an appealing reading experience for business people and sports fans alike. --John Moe', N'<h3 class="review">From Amazon.com

Lean Development and Agile Methods for Large-Scale Products: Key Thinking and Organizational Tools for Sustainable Competitive Success 

Increasingly, large product-development organizations are turning to lean thinking, agile principles and practices, and large-scale Scrum to sustainably and quickly deliver value and innovation. However, many groups have floundered in their practice-oriented adoptions. Why? Because without a deeper understanding of the thinking tools and profound organizational redesign needed, it is as though casting seeds on to an infertile field.

 The bestselling book for every boy from eight to eighty, covering essential boyhood skills such as building tree houses, learning how to fish, finding true north, and even answering the age old question of what the big deal with girls is. 
 In this digital age there is still a place for knots, skimming stones and stories of incredible courage. This book recaptures Sunday afternoons, stimulates curiosity, and makes for great father-son activities.

Equal parts droll and gorgeous nostalgia book and heartfelt plea for a renewed sense of adventure in the lives of boys and men, Conn and Hal Iggulden''s The Dangerous Book for Boys became a mammoth bestseller in the United Kingdom in 2006. Adapted, in moderation, for American customs in this edition (cricket is gone, rugby remains; conkers are out, Navajo Code Talkers in), The Dangerous Book is a guide book for dads as well as their sons, as a reminder of lore and technique that have not yet been completely lost to the digital age. Recall the adventures of Scott of the Antarctic and the Battle of the Somme, relearn how to palm a coin, tan a skin, and, most charmingly, wrap a package in brown paper and string. The book''s ambitions are both modest and winningly optimistic: you get the sense that by learning how to place a splint or write in invisible ink, a boy might be prepared for anything, even girls (which warrant a small but wise chapter of their own).

Figure 8 KnotSheet Bend Knot
The Battle of Waterloo

Questions for Conn Iggulden
  Conn and Hal Iggulden are two brothers who have not forgotten what it was like to be boys. Conn taught for many years before becoming one of the most admired and popular young historical novelists with his Emperor series, based on the life of Julius Caesar, and his newly embarked series on Genghis Khan, while Hal is a theater director. We asked Conn about their collaboration.  
Amazon.com: It''s difficult to describe what a phenomenon The Dangerous Book for Boys was in the UK last year. When I would check the bestseller list on our sister site, Amazon.co.uk, there would be, along with your book, which spent much of the year at the top of the list, a half-dozen apparent knockoff books of similar boy knowledge. Clearly, you tapped into something big. What do you think it was?  
Iggulden: In a word, fathers. I am one myself and I think we''ve become aware that the whole "health and safety" overprotective culture isn''t doing our sons any favors. Boys need to learn about risk. They need to fall off things occasionally, or--and this is the important bit--they''ll take worse risks on their own. If we do away with challenging playgrounds and cancel school trips for fear of being sued, we don''t end up with safer boys--we end up with them walking on train tracks. In the long run, it''s not safe at all to keep our boys in the house with a Playstation. It''s not good for their health or their safety.  
  You only have to push a boy on a swing to see how much enjoys the thrill of danger. It''s hard-wired. Remove any opportunity to test his courage and they''ll find ways to test themselves that will be seriously dangerous for everyone around them. I think of it like playing the lottery--someone has to say "Look, you won''t win--and your children won''t be hurt. Relax. It won''t be you."   
  I think that''s the core of the book''s success. It isn''t just a collection of things to do. The heroic stories alone are something we haven''t had for too long. It isn''t about climbing Everest, but it is an attitude, a philosophy for fathers and sons. Our institutions are too wrapped up in terror over being sued--so we have to do things with them ourselves. This book isn''t a bad place to start.  
  As for knockoff books--great. They''ll give my son something to read that doesn''t involve him learning a dull moral lesson of some kind--just enjoying an adventure or learning skills and crafts so that he has a feeling of competence and confidence--just as we have.  
Amazon.com: You made some changes for the U.S. edition, and I for one am sorry that you have removed the section on conkers, if only because it''s such a lovely and mysterious word. What are (or what is) conkers?  
Iggulden: Horse chestnuts strung on a shoelace and knocked against one another until they shatter. In the entire history of the world, no one has ever been hurt by a conker, but it''s still been banned by some British schools, just in case. Another school banned paper airplanes. Honestly, it''s enough to make you weep, if I did that sort of thing, which I try not to. Reading Jane Austen is still allowed, however.  
Amazon.com: What knowledge did you decide was important to add for American boys? I notice in both editions you have an excellent and useful section on table football, as played with coins. Is paper football strictly an American pastime? I''m not sure I could have gotten through the fourth grade without it.  
Iggulden: I like knowing the details of battles, so Gettysburg and the Alamo had to go in, along with the Gettysburg address, stickball, state capitals, U.S. mountains, American trees, insects, U.S. historical timelines, and a lot of others. Navajo code talkers of WWII is a great chapter. It probably helps that I am a huge fan of America. It was only while rewriting for the U.S. that I realized how many positive references there already are. You have NASA and NASA trumps almost anything.   
  As for paper football, ever since I thought of putting the book together, people keep saying things like "You have rockets in there, yes? Everyone loves rockets!" Paper football is the first American one, but there will be many others. No book in the world is long enough to put them all in--unless we do a sequel, of course.  
Amazon.com: Do you think The Dangerous Book for Boys is being read by actual boys, or only by nostalgic adults? Have you seen boys getting up from their Xboxes to go outside and perform first aid or tan animal skins or build go-carts?  
Iggulden: I''ve had a lot of emails and letters from boys who loved the book--as well as fathers. I''ve had responses from kids as young as ten and an old man of 87, who pointed out a problem with the shadow stick that we''ve since changed. The thing to remember is that we may be older and more cynical every year, but boys simply aren''t. If they are given the chance to make a go-cart with their dad, they jump at it. Mine did. Nothing gives me more pleasure than to know the book is being used with fathers and sons together, trying things out. Nothing is more valuable to a boy than time with his dad, learning something fun--or something difficult. That''s part of the attitude too. If it''s hard, you don''t make it easy, you grab it by the throat and hang on for as long as it takes.  
  The book is often bought by fathers, of course. Their sons don''t know Scott of the Antarctic is a great adventure story. How could they if it isn''t taught any more? Good, heroic stories don''t appear much in modern school curriculums--and then we wonder why boys don''t seem interested.  
Amazon.com: And finally, on to the important questions: Should Pluto still be a planet? And what was the best dinosaur?  
Iggulden: Pluto is a planet. I know there are scientists who say it isn''t, but it''s big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it''s a planet. Give it ten years and they''ll be agreeing with me again.  
  As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well. The only thing that will stop us is worrying too much.

I know there are scientists who say it isn''t, but it''s big enough to be round and it has a moon, for crying out loud. Of course it''s a planet. Give it ten years and they''ll be agreeing with me again.  <p>  As for the best dinosaur, it depends what you mean by best. For sheer perfection, it probably has to be the shark and the crocodile. Modern ones are smaller but their record for sheer survival is pretty impressive. I only hope humanity can do as well. The only thing that will stop us is worrying too much.  </p>

HTML is the language of the web. If you need to build a web page, then you''ll have to start with HTML. The most recent specification: HTML 4.01 defines several new features including expanded support for multimedia, style sheets (including aural style sheets, and the new CSS specifications), scripting, and new accessibility and internationalization standards. HTML 4.01 also includes updated support for familiar features such as text formatting, hyperlinking, forms, frames, and tables, and supports the very latest browser versions including Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6 and Opera 5.     
HTML Programmer''s Reference (4.01 Edition) covers all these new and established features in detail and provides you with the knowledge and the skills to write great web pages that will be supported by all major browsers.

Amazon.com Review
Suitable for almost anyone who develops Web applications, HTML 4.01 Programmer''s Reference provides a thorough tour of HTML and related standards, covering every tag and attribute in the new 4.01 standard. 
    The strength of this book is that it serves as a guide to some of the best thinking in Web-page design using the latest in approved (and emerging) Internet standards. The authors explain HTML literally from the ground up and cover the structure of Web pages, starting with headers to body tags. Subsequent sections drill down into formatting text and common features like tables, links, and images. Throughout the book, the authors provide advice on the right way to do things for good cross-browser Web design. There''s plenty on more advanced (and vendor-specific) features in both the Microsoft and Netscape browsers--for example, on frames and cascading style sheets. 
    The book consistently teaches best practices on what works and what doesn''t. Later sections look at "deprecated" or obsolete tags. An appendix that lists every HTML tag and its level of support from HTML 2.0 through 4.01 and on browsers from Netscape and Microsoft from version 3 through version 6 more than justifies the cost of this reference. 
    Besides HTML 4.01 support, the book also offers a glimpse of new or emerging standards that every Web developer arguably should be aware of. From aural style sheets (which provide tags that work with sound and voice), to XHTML 1.0/1.1 and XHTML Basic (the designated heir to WAP/WML for wireless), HTML 4.01 Programmer''s Reference provides a look into the future of Web content. Its cross-browser perspective on some best practices for designing Web content adds yet more value. --Richard Dragan

Emotional Intelligence was an international phenomenon, appearing on the New York Times bestseller list for over a year and selling more than five million copies worldwide. Now, once again, Daniel Goleman has written a groundbreaking synthesis of the latest findings in biology and brain science, revealing that we are “wired to connect” and the surprisingly deep impact of our relationships on every aspect of our lives.Far more than we are consciously aware, our daily encounters with parents, spouses, bosses, and even strangers shape our brains and affect cells throughout our bodies—down to the level of our genes—for good or ill. In Social Intelligence, Daniel Goleman explores an emerging new science with startling implications for our interpersonal world.  Its most fundamental discovery: we are designed for sociability, constantly engaged in a “neural ballet” that connects us brain to brain with those around us.Our reactions to others, and theirs to us, have a far-reaching biological impact, sending out cascades of hormones that regulate everything from our hearts to our immune systems, making good relationships act like vitamins—and bad relationships like poisons. We can “catch” other people’s emotions the way we catch a cold, and the consequences of isolation or relentless social stress can be life-shortening. Goleman explains the surprising accuracy of first impressions, the basis of charisma and emotional power, the complexity of sexual attraction, and how we detect lies. He describes the “dark side” of social intelligence, from narcissism to Machiavellianism and psychopathy. He also reveals our astonishing capacity for “mindsight,” as well as the tragedy of those, like autistic children, whose mindsight is impaired.Is there a way to raise our children to be happy?  What is the basis of a nourishing marriage?  How can business leaders and teachers inspire the best in those they lead and teach?  How can groups divided by prejudice and hatred come to live together in peace?  The answers to these questions may not be as elusive as we once thought.  And Goleman delivers his most heartening news with powerful conviction: we humans have a built-in bias toward empathy, cooperation, and altruism–provided we develop the social intelligence to nurture these capacities in ourselves and others.

Most programming languages contain good and bad parts, but JavaScript has more than its share of the bad, having been developed and released in a hurry before it could be refined. This authoritative book scrapes away these bad features to reveal a subset of JavaScript that''s more reliable, readable, and maintainable than the language as a whole-a subset you can use to create truly extensible and efficient code. Considered the JavaScript expert by many people in the development community, author Douglas Crockford identifies the abundance of good ideas that make JavaScript an outstanding object-oriented programming language-ideas such as functions, loose typing, dynamic objects, and an expressive object literal notation. Unfortunately, these good ideas are mixed in with bad and downright awful ideas, like a programming model based on global variables.  When Java applets failed, JavaScript became the language of the Web by default, making its popularity almost completely independent of its qualities as a programming language. In JavaScript: The Good Parts, Crockford finally digs through the steaming pile of good intentions and blunders to give you a detailed look at all the genuinely elegant parts of JavaScript, including:SyntaxObjectsFunctionsInheritanceArraysRegular expressionsMethodsStyleBeautiful features

Based on more than forty interviews with Jobs conducted over two years—as well as interviews with more than a hundred family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues—Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing. 
At a time when America is seeking ways to sustain its innovative edge, and when societies around the world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination. He knew that the best way to create value in the twenty-first century was to connect creativity with technology. He built a company where leaps of the imagination were combined with remarkable feats of engineering.   
Although Jobs cooperated with this book, he asked for no control over what was written nor even the right to read it before it was published. He put nothing off-limits. He encouraged the people he knew to speak honestly. And Jobs speaks candidly, sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions, artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his approach to business and the innovative products that resulted. 
Driven by demons, Jobs could drive those around him to fury and despair. But his personality and products were interrelated, just as Apple’s hardware and software tended to be, as if part of an integrated system. His tale is instructive and cautionary, filled with lessons about innovation, character, leadership, and values.

Amazon.com Review
Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011: It is difficult to read the opening pages of Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs without feeling melancholic. Jobs retired at the end of August and died about six weeks later. Now, just weeks after his death, you can open the book that bears his name and read about his youth, his promise, and his relentless press to succeed. But the initial sadness in starting the book is soon replaced by something else, which is the intensity of the read--mirroring the intensity of Jobs’s focus and vision for his products. Few in history have transformed their time like Steve Jobs, and one could argue that he stands with the Fords, Edisons, and Gutenbergs of the world. This is a timely and complete portrait that pulls no punches and gives insight into a man whose contradictions were in many ways his greatest strength. --Chris Schluep
 Amazon Exclusive: A Q&A with Walter Isaacson 
Q: It''s becoming well known that Jobs was able to create his Reality Distortion Field when it served him. Was it difficult for you to cut through the RDF and get beneath the narrative that he created? How did you do it? 
Isaacson: Andy Hertzfeld, who worked with Steve on the original Macintosh team, said that even if you were aware of his Reality Distortion Field, you still got caught up in it. But that is why Steve was so successful: He willfully bent reality so that you became convinced you could do the impossible, so you did. I never felt he was intentionally misleading me, but I did try to check every story. I did more than a hundred interviews. And he urged me not just to hear his version, but to interview as many people as possible. It was one of his many odd contradictions: He could distort reality, yet he was also brutally honest most of the time. He impressed upon me the value of honesty, rather than trying to whitewash things.
Q: How were the interviews with Jobs conducted? Did you ask lots of questions, or did he just talk? 
Isaacson: I asked very few questions. We would take long walks or drives, or sit in his garden, and I would raise a topic and let him expound on it. Even during the more formal sessions in his living room, I would just sit quietly and listen. He loved to tell stories, and he would get very emotional, especially when talking about people in his life whom he admired or disdained.
Q: He was a powerful man who could hold a grudge. Was it easy to get others to talk about Jobs willingly? Were they afraid to talk? 
Isaacson: Everyone was eager to talk about Steve. They all had stories to tell, and they loved to tell them. Even those who told me about his rough manner put it in the context of how inspiring he could be.
Q: Jobs embraced the counterculture and Buddhism. Yet he was a billionaire businessman with his own jet. In what way did Jobs'' contradictions contribute to his success?
Isaacson: Steve was filled with contradictions. He was a counterculture rebel who became a billionaire. He eschewed material objects yet made objects of desire. He talked, at times, about how he wrestled with these contradictions. His counterculture background combined with his love of electronics and business was key to the products he created. They combined artistry and technology. 
Q: Jobs could be notoriously difficult. Did you wind up liking him in the end? 
Isaacson: Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. 
Q: Do you believe he was a genius? 
Isaacson: He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.
Q: Did he have regrets? 
Isaacson: He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.
Q: What do you think is his legacy?
Isaacson: His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his "Think Different" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.

Did you wind up liking him in the end? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> Yes, I liked him and was inspired by him. But I knew he could be unkind and rough. These things can go together. When my book first came out, some people skimmed it quickly and cherry-picked the examples of his being rude to people. But that was only half the story. Fortunately, as people read the whole book, they saw the theme of the narrative: He could be petulant and rough, but this was driven by his passion and pursuit of perfection. He liked people to stand up to him, and he said that brutal honesty was required to be part of his team. And the teams he built became extremely loyal and inspired. </p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe he was a genius? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He was a genius at connecting art to technology, of making leaps based on intuition and imagination. He knew how to make emotional connections with those around him and with his customers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Did he have regrets? </p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> He had some regrets, which he expressed in his interviews. For example, he said that he did not handle well the pregnancy of his first girlfriend. But he was deeply satisfied by the creativity he ingrained at Apple and the loyalty of both his close colleagues and his family.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What do you think is his legacy?</p> <p><strong>Isaacson:</strong> His legacy is transforming seven industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, digital publishing, and retail stores. His legacy is creating what became the most valuable company on earth, one that stood at the intersection of the humanities and technology, and is the company most likely still to be doing that a generation from now. His legacy, as he said in his "Think Different" ad, was reminding us that the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do.</p> <p> <b>Photo credit:</b> Patrice Gilbert Photography</p>

In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team Patrick Lencioni once again offers a leadership fable that is as enthralling and instructive as his first two best-selling books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and The Four Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive. This time, he turns his keen intellect and storytelling power to the fascinating, complex world of teams.Kathryn Petersen, Decision Tech''s CEO, faces the ultimate leadership crisis: Uniting a team in such disarray that it threatens to bring down the entire company. Will she succeed? Will she be fired? Will the company fail? Lencioni''s utterly gripping tale serves as a timeless reminder that leadership requires as much courage as it does insight.Throughout the story, Lencioni reveals the five dysfunctions which go to the very heart of why teams even the best ones-often struggle. He outlines a powerful model and actionable steps that can be used to overcome these common hurdles and build a cohesive, effective team. Just as with his other books, Lencioni has written a compelling fable with a powerful yet deceptively simple message for all those who strive to be exceptional team leaders.

Amazon.com Review
Once again using an astutely written fictional tale to unambiguously but painlessly deliver some hard truths about critical business procedures, Patrick Lencioni targets group behavior in the final entry of his trilogy of corporate fables. And like those preceding it, The Five Dysfunctions of a Team is an entertaining, quick read filled with useful information that will prove easy to digest and implement. This time, Lencioni weaves his lessons around the story of a troubled Silicon Valley firm and its unexpected choice for a new CEO: an old-school manager who had retired from a traditional manufacturing company two years earlier at age 55. Showing exactly how existing personnel failed to function as a unit, and precisely how the new boss worked to reestablish that essential conduct, the book''s first part colorfully illustrates the ways that teamwork can elude even the most dedicated individuals--and be restored by an insightful leader. A second part offers details on Lencioni''s "five dysfunctions" (absence of trust, fear of conflict, lack of commitment, avoidance of accountability, and inattention to results), along with a questionnaire for readers to use in evaluating their own teams and specifics to help them understand and overcome these common shortcomings. Like the author''s previous books, The Five Temptations of a CEO and Obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive, this is highly recommended. --Howard Rothman', N'<h3 class="review">Product Description

Google''s Android is shaking up the mobile market in a big way. With Android, you can write programs that run on any compatible cell phone or tablet in the world. It''s a mobile platform you can''t afford not to learn, and this book gets you started. Hello, Android has been updated to Android 2.3.3, with revised code throughout to reflect this updated version. That means that the book is now up-to-date for tablets such as the Kindle Fire. All examples were tested for forwards and backwards compatibility on a variety of devices and versions of Android from 1.5 to 4.0. (Note: the Kindle Fire does not support home screen widgets or wallpaper, so those samples couldn''t be tested on the Fire.) Android is an operating system for mobile phones and tablets. It''s inside millions of cell phones and other devices, including the hugely popular Amazon Kindle Fire, making Android the foremost platform for mobile application developers. That could be your own program running on all those devices. Within minutes, Hello, Android will get you started creating your first working application: Android''s version of "Hello, World." From there, you''ll build up a more substantial example: an Android Sudoku game. By gradually adding features to the game, you''ll learn the basics of Android programming. You''ll also see how to build in audio and video support, add graphics using 2D and 3D OpenGL, network with web pages and web services, and store data with SQLite. You''ll also learn how to publish your applications to the Android Market. The #1 book for learning Android is now in its third edition. Every page and example was reviewed and updated for compatibility with the latest versions. Freshly added material covers installing applications to the SD card, supporting multi-touch, and creating live wallpaper. You''ll also find plenty of real-world advice on how to support all major Android versions in use today.

Succinctly and clearly written, this book examines dozens of real-world uses of the Canvas API, such as interactively drawing and manipulating shapes, saving and restoring the drawing surface to temporarily draw shapes and text, and implementing text controls. You''ll see how to keep your applications responsive with web workers when you filter images, how to implement smooth animations, and how to create layered, 3D scrolling backgrounds with parallax. In addition, you''ll see how to implement video games with extensive coverage of sprites, physics, collision detection, and the implementation of a game engine and an industrial-strength pinball game. The book concludes by showing you how to implement Canvas-based controls that you can use in any HTML5 application and how to use Canvas on mobile devices, including iOS5. This authoritative Canvas reference covers The canvas element--using it with other HTML elements, handling events, printing a canvas, and using offscreen canvasesShapes--drawing, dragging, erasing, and editing lines, arcs, circles, curves, and polygons; using shadows, gradients, and patternsText--drawing, positioning, setting font properties; building text controlsImages--drawing, scaling, clipping, processing, and animatingAnimations--creating smooth, efficient, and portable animationsSprites--implementing animated objects that have painters and behaviorsPhysics--modeling physical systems (falling bodies, pendulums, and projectiles), and implementing tweening for nonlinear motion and animationCollision detection--advanced techniques, clearly explainedGame development--all aspects of game development, such as time-based motion and high score support, implemented in a game engineCustom controls--infrastructure for implementing custom controls; implementing progress bars, sliders, and an image pannerMobile applications--fitting Canvas apps on a mobile screen, using media queries, handling touch events, and specifying iOS5 artifacts, such as app icons   Throughout the book, Geary discusses high-quality, reusable code to help professional developers learn everything they really need to know, with no unnecessary verbiage.

Amazon Best Books of the Month, April 2011: Tina Fey’s new book Bossypants is short, messy, and impossibly funny (an apt description of the comedian herself). From her humble roots growing up in Pennsylvania to her days doing amateur improv in Chicago to her early sketches on Saturday Night Live, Fey gives us a fascinating glimpse behind the curtain of modern comedy with equal doses of wit, candor, and self-deprecation. Some of the funniest chapters feature the differences between male and female comedy writers ("men urinate in cups"), her cruise ship honeymoon ("it’s very Poseidon Adventure"), and advice about breastfeeding ("I had an obligation to my child to pretend to try"). But the chaos of Fey’s life is best detailed when she’s dividing her efforts equally between rehearsing her Sarah Palin impression, trying to get Oprah to appear on 30 Rock, and planning her daughter’s Peter Pan-themed birthday. Bossypants gets to the heart of why Tina Fey remains universally adored: she embodies the hectic, too-many-things-to-juggle lifestyle we all have, but instead of complaining about it, she can just laugh it off. --Kevin Nguyen', N'<h3 class="review">Product Description

His most bitter rival, Lord Stannis, stands defeated and disgraced, the victim of the jealous sorceress who holds him in her evil thrall. But young Robb, of House Stark, still rules the North from the fortress of Riverrun. Robb plots against his despised Lannister enemies, even as they hold his sister hostage at King’s Landing, the seat of the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, making her way across a blood-drenched continent is the exiled queen, Daenerys, mistress of the only three dragons still left in the world. . . .But as opposing forces maneuver for the final titanic showdown, an army of barbaric wildlings arrives from the outermost line of civilization. In their vanguard is a horde of mythical Others—a supernatural army of the living dead whose animated corpses are unstoppable.

Amazon.com Review
Is George R.R. Martin for real? Can a fantasy epic actually get  better with each new installment? Fans of the genre have glumly come to  expect go-nowhere sequels from other authors, so we''re entitled to pinch  ourselves over Martin''s tightly crafted Song of Ice and Fire series. The reports  are all true: this series is the real deal, and Martin deserves his crown as the  rightful king of the epic. A Game  of Thrones got things off to a rock-solid start, A Clash of Kings only exceeded  expectations, but it''s the Storm of Swords hat trick that cements  Martin''s rep as the most praiseworthy fantasy author to come along since that  other R.R.
 Like the first two books, A Storm of Swords could coast on the  fundamentals: deftly detailed characters, convincing voices and dialogue, a  robust back-story, and a satisfyingly unpredictable plot. But it''s Martin''s  consistently bold choices that set the series apart. Every character is fair  game for the headman''s axe (sometimes literally), and not only do the good guys  regularly lose out to the bad guys, you''re never exactly sure who you should be  cheering for in the first place.
Storm is full of admirable intricacies. Events that you thought Martin  was setting up solidly for the first two books are exposed as complex feints;  the field quickly narrows after the Battle of the Blackwater and once again,  anything goes. Robb tries desperately to hold the North together, Jon returns  from the wildling lands with a torn heart, Bran continues his quest for the  three-eyed crow beyond the Wall, Catelyn struggles to save her fragile family,  Arya becomes ever more wolflike in her wanderings, Daenerys comes into her own,  and Joffrey''s cruel rule from King''s Landing continues, making even his fellow  Lannisters uneasy. Martin tests all the major characters in A Storm of  Swords: some fail the trial, while others--like Martin himself--seem to only  get stronger. --Paul Hughes', N'<h3 class="review">Product Description

The need to handle increasingly larger data volumes is one factor driving the adoption of a new class of nonrelational “NoSQL” databases. Advocates of NoSQL databases claim they can be used to build systems that are more performant, scale better, and are easier to program.

NoSQL Distilled is a concise but thorough introduction to this rapidly emerging technology. Pramod J. Sadalage and Martin Fowler explain how NoSQL databases work and the ways that they may be a superior alternative to a traditional RDBMS. The authors provide a fast-paced guide to the concepts you need to know in order to evaluate whether NoSQL databases are right for your needs and, if so, which technologies you should explore further.

The first part of the book concentrates on core concepts, including schemaless data models, aggregates, new distribution models, the CAP theorem, and map-reduce. In the second part, the authors explore architectural and design issues associated with implementing NoSQL. They also present realistic use cases that demonstrate NoSQL databases at work and feature representative examples using Riak, MongoDB, Cassandra, and Neo4j.

In addition, by drawing on Pramod Sadalage’s pioneering work, NoSQL Distilled shows how to implement evolutionary design with schema migration: an essential technique for applying NoSQL databases. The book concludes by describing how NoSQL is ushering in a new age of Polyglot Persistence, where multiple data-storage worlds coexist, and architects can choose the technology best optimized for each type of data access.

“Ruby on Rails™ 3 Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example by Michael Hartl has become a must read for developers learning how to build Rails apps.” 
—Peter Cooper, Editor of Ruby Inside

Using Rails 3, developers can build web applications of exceptional elegance and power. Although its remarkable capabilities have made Ruby on Rails one of the world’s most popular web development frameworks, it can be challenging to learn and use. Ruby on Rails™ 3 Tutorial is the solution. Leading Rails developer Michael Hartl teaches Rails 3 by guiding you through the development of your own complete sample application using the latest techniques in Rails web development.

Drawing on his experience building RailsSpace, Insoshi, and other sophisticated Rails applications, Hartl illuminates all facets of design and implementation—including powerful new techniques that simplify and accelerate development. 

You’ll find integrated tutorials not only for Rails, but also for the essential Ruby, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL skills you’ll need when developing web applications. Hartl explains how each new technique solves a real-world problem, and he demonstrates this with bite-sized code that’s simple enough to understand, yet novel enough to be useful. Whatever your previous web development experience, this book will guide you to true Rails mastery.
